_Wisdom from our tree-dwelling rodent friends_

###### ![a squirrel](assets/squirrel.jpg)

My sister saw a bumper sticker today that said "Think like a squirrel."
Naturally, she asked me what I thought it meant. Here's what I've got.

1. Plan ahead. Meal prep for the week and bury leftovers in the yard.
2. Often, the best way to gain perspective on a situation is to climb a tree, e.g. when you're lost in the woods or mad at your boss.
3. Stop talking so much. Sometimes what you need to say is just a few squeaks.
4. Stop thinking so much. I've never seen a squirrel ruminate.
5. Change your mind frequently and without hesitation, especially in the middle of the street.
