Sometimes it feels like the powers that be are trying to make the Internet
less linked together by making links worse. For example, if
you make a post on LinkedIn. they automatically change your link into a new
link that goes to a scary page that says "You're about to leave LinkedIn.
Are you sure you want to leave us? There might be scary things out there. You
really ought to stay. You'll be safe here with us. Come back in. You appeared
in six searches this week. Come back. And never fucking leave again you swine!
Get your ass back over here!" It's not a great experience.

So, anyway, here are some links to other sites or newsletters that I like. Happy surfing :)
