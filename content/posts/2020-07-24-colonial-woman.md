... or househusband.

In these times of little precedence, it has been a
challenge for all of us to adjust from the old normal
to a new one. But, nevertheless, there is always a bright
side, usually. I could probably think of a few things
without a bright side if I really tried. Maybe Cats: The Musical or
that one time when a seagull stole my french fry.
Damn you, Mr. Seagull! Damn you!

The raging pandemic, however terrible,
has given me a lot of time to reflect on
my values and my beliefs. It has made me
realize that I have a little colonial housewife
deep inside me. Perhaps we all do.

I realized this one day after a run while
I was washing my government recommended facial
covering (ne√© bandana) in the sink. I run multiple
 times a week, but only do laundry weekly, so the
bandana gets washed by hand. I squeeze some soap on it,
soak it, and then rub it on my soap dish (pictured below)
that sort of functions as an old fashioned washing board.
I hum and smile, knowing that I've become the perfectly
domesticated 17th Century woman I always wanted to be.

Tomorrow, I think I will go out and find a cow to
milk and then maybe churn some butter. I hope they
have cows in Boston. I wonder how many petticoats I
should order from Etsy. Did they have running water
in colonial America? Did they wash their clothes in the sink,
or did they need to lug them to the river?
Let me know in the comments!
