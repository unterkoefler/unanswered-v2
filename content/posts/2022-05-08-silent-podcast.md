*Having been banned from Spotify, Apple Podcasts, SoundCloud, Parler, 4chan
and all other reputable podcast platforms, the intrepid content
creators at [Unanswered.blog](http://Unanswered.blog) now
bring you an innovative new podcast in an innovative new
medium: the text-based Silent Podcast.*

Close your eyes, dear reader, as we embark
on this two hour guided meditation journey. Feel the
weight of your eyelids as they droop slowly over your
tired eyes. Watch as these words drift out of
focus and everything turns dark. Listen to your breathing.
For each inhale, pick a worry or negative thought
you have had today. Breathe in deeply. Then,
exhale, letting your negative thought flow out. Worry in, worry out.

Still there? Maybe you’re not very good
at this. Close your eyes again. They’re
so heavy. Now, exhale away that negative thought
. You *are* good at this. You’re not even reading this. How could you?
Your eyes are closed. You’re letting your negative thoughts float away.
You’re breathing deeply. You’re aware of your body, from the tiniest cells
in your toes to the slight itch on your left shoulder.
No, don’t scratch it. Focus. It’s not even that itchy. Let the itch
fade away with the rest of your worries.

Where were we? Right, you had your eyes closed and had stopped thinking
about the itch on your shoulder. You also weren’t reading this,
since your eyes are closed and you’re meditating peacefully.
Please stop reading this. Okay, that’s better. Now, as you let go
of your fears and worries, remember not to judge yourself for having
these thoughts. It’s normal to think that you have a big nose. It’s
really quite large. And that embarrassing thing you shared at dinner
the other night? Yeah, you definitely shouldn’t have said anything,
but then you kept going and made it so much worse. Exhale away these
thoughts. They’re true, but there’s no reason to dwell on them. You
won’t be invited back, but who needs friends anyway. There’s more
content on [Unanswered.blog](http://Unanswered.blog) that you haven’t consumed yet.
