_"It's okay to eat racist chickens"_

FINCHVILLE, KY â€” In a joint statement, vegan advocacy groups Veganize the Nation and Cruelty Free America
expressed that although they find the slaughter and consumption of animals morally reprehensible
in general, a clear exception to strictly vegan diets could be made for the new KKKFC Sandwich from
KFC. "Racist chickens have no rights," the statement reads. "It's okay to eat them."

The statement has been met with an outpouring of support on social media, as individual vegetarians
and meat-alternative company spokespeople chime in. "Hell yeah! F\*\*\* those chickens!" reply-tweeted the
official Impossible Foods, Inc account. PETA, whose mission statement that "animals are not ours to eat,
wear, experiment on, or use for entertainment" probably extends to malaria-infected mosquitoes, shared the statement on its Tumblr page, adding that "It's not
okay to be mean to animals, but it's more not okay to not kill racist animals." An account thought to belong
to ethicist Peter Singer re-blogged PETA's post.

The sandwich in question was announced by KFC last Monday. It will be available in
select stores across the country for a limited time only. Served on a brioche-style bun
with The Colonel's "magic" sauce, the deep fried, all-white, alt-right, breast meat sandwich
is sure to be a hit.

Vegans, desperate to finally eat some good food that they can also feel good about,
have started to camp out at KFC locations rumored to be receiving shipments of the new KKKFC Sandwich.
"I haven't eaten any protein in six years," said Kyle, a local vegan, faintly. "I hope I'm able to get one. They said
supplies are real limited."

"But yeah, we're really just out here to end racism," whispered a voice from farther within the tent.

"In chickens," Kyle added.

Unfortunately for Kyle and other vegans, but fortunately for race relations in America, supplies are indeed limited.
Only about 2,000 of KFC's millions of chickens were initially found to support white supremecist
ideologies. The discoveries began last month when a factory worker uncovered a shrine to David Duke inside one coop
at KFC's largest farm outside of Louisville, KY. A closer examination revealed that many of the chickens had stashed chicken-sized
white robes in their closets. A scheduled showing of _The Birth of a Nation_ was cancelled. All the chickens implicated were
quickly isolated and will soon be butchered, much to everyone's delight. The remaining chickens at that farm will receive
racial sensitivity training, and will then also be butchered. Investigations at KFC's other farms continue.

When reached for comment, a Popeyes spokesperson said, "Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen is proud to serve only
meat from chickens who identify with one or more minority groups. Louisiana, fast!"

"Hold up. Isn't that worse?" added Kyle.
