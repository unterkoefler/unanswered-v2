I'm waiting for a weighted blanket.\
It's in the cart.\
It's on its way.

I'm waiting for a weighted blanket.\
One the Fedex man needs his dolly for,\
One I can't lift up the stairs.\
I'll sleep in the lobby and\
In the morning the neighbors\
Will walk right over.

I won't feel a thing.

I'm waiting for a weighted blanket\
One to cuddle and snuggle and to\
Pin me motionless to my mattress.\
One to hold me tight\
I'll hold you tight.
