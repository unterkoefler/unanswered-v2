## Warning: Entering Derboxel Country

Leave ALL Rectangular Prisms in your car.

Carry Anti-derboxel spray at all times.

In case of encounter, follow the 4 "ays": LAY down, PLAY dead, PRAY and then SPRAY.

Hard corners must be beveled. Likewise, make no sharp turns.

Absolutely no singing, humming, strumming, or scatting. Whistling encouraged.

Stampedes are rare but can occur. Know the signs and get to high ground immediately.

Triangles, if necessary, should be scalene. Some isosceles permitted if medically required.
Consult a ranger to help weigh your risk.

Do NOT hike at dusk or dawn.

Beware trip wires, deadfalls, nets, terpingangulars, and brightly colored leaves.

Failure to comply with these notices will result in a $4,962 fine per S.M.F.R. Section 128.9 Provision E.

"The only thing more dangerous than a derboxel you can see is the one you can't."

Happy hiking!
