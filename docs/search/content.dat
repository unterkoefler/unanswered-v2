It was a dreary midnight in a bleak December. Fred was thinking about signing off for
the night and hurrying home to crank up the space heater and crawl under a heap of
blankets. He was huddled up in a doorway somewhere near his last delivery, staying
out of the wind while he waited for the next one to come in. He shuffled his feet and
wondered if werewolves still got cold when they were in human form. He was sure they'd
be warm in wolf form, but he didn't think it would be worth getting bit if the warmth
was only there for a couple of days each month. Plus, he could get rabies if he wasn't
careful.

Fred Lee believed in many things--too many, his aunt would say. "There is only one
God. Is His infinite Love not enough for you?" she would say, capitalizing the
important words with her voice. "Why do you go chasing
your monsters and fairies in the woods?"

Fred was unsure about the all-loving father in the sky, but he was unwavering in his
belief in sasquatches and Yeti and chupacabras, goblins and mothmen and Jersey devils,
weevils and djinn and kami and all else that goes bump in the night. The other thing
Fred believed in, despite all evidence to the contrary, was himself. After earning his
master's degree in cultural anthropology with a focus on contemporary cryptozoology,
Fred had struggled to find work that was relevant to his degree. Last week he had applied
for the sixth time to a position at the city's natural history museum. Fred believed
that this time they would call him back.

For now though, Fred was doing delivery through one of the apps. It was a temporary gig,
something super temporary, he had said, just something temporary to pay the bills until
the job market picked up again. Yesterday, Unlivery had sent him an email congratulating
him on his first "unliveraversary" and being a "high-rated, 4.8 smiley-face unliverer!"
"Unlivery: It's not delivery. It's different," read the email's footer. Fred wondered
sometimes if their marketing department was in on the joke, if they really knew how
dumb they sounded. He couldn't decide. He found their patronizing emails grating and
couldn't stand their lime green brand color, but it was the only delivery app in the
city that offered health insurance and, anyways, the museum would be getting back to him
soon.

From the mount on his bike's handlebars, his phone lit up bright green and dinged
a cheerful ding. There it was: his last delivery. Fred quickly accepted the job.
At a glance, the custom delivery instructions seemed long and tedious, but he could
read them later. The tip was good and the restaurant was Jade Garden, one of Fred's
favorites. One more delivery, he thought. Two large vegetable lo meins carried just
over two miles to 202 Kingsford Place, Apartment 322, and then the sweet warmth of home.
One more delivery and no more.

Fred tugged his gloves back on, hopped on his bike and pedalled into the dark streets. As
he picked up speed, the cold wind bit at his cheeks and snuck into his gloves. It's
good to be alive, thought Fred, but it'd be better to be a werewolf. Or a Yeti! Yes, a
Yeti would be perfectly warm all year round. Standing up on the pedals, Fred pumped his
way up a steep hill. All downhill from here, he thought. All downhill from here. He
wondered about all the two's in this delivery. Fred wasn't sure if it was a good sign
or a bad one. He didn't know of any cultures where two was considered lucky or unlucky.
People the world over seemed indifferent about the number two. He should call his old
professor to confirm. He hoped two would prove lucky tonight. Two-night! Ha!

He had arrived at Jade Garden. He leaned his lime green bike against a spindly tree
and hurried inside. Unlivery had made him spray-paint his bike that color--at his own
expense--but he wasn't really upset about it anymore. He hadn't warmed to the color,
but, somehow, it had made his bike immune to theft. There seemed to be a tacit agreement
among all the criminals and would-be criminals in the city to leave all the brightly
colored delivery bikes alone. Maybe the apps were paying off the mob. Maybe the
criminals used the apps too and didn't want their orders slowed down by the locking
and unlocking of bicycles. Fred thought the fairies were involved.

"N«ê h«éo h«î zi!" shouted Ms. Lin, the restaurant's owner. Fred grinned in greeting and
then frowned in focus, trying to keep up with Ms. Lin's rapid stream of chatter.
His Chinese had gotten rustier and rustier since moving out of his aunt's place. And
Ms. Lin often didn't make much sense, which didn't help matters either. She was going on
about bad omens and dark wings come in on cold winds and then suddenly about her
daughter, Linda, and when would she and Fred finally get married or could he at least
take her on a date, she was so lonely, and so beautiful, too, and wouldn't it be nice
if he took her out for some good Italian food, wouldn't it be nice for him to take a
break from all his studying and treat Linda to something nice for a change before she
got all old and wrinkly like her poor mom? Ms. Lin was somehow under the impression that
Fred was in medical school and only working delivery to pay for his classes. Fred had
never said anything to suggest as much, but he hadn't protested when she had first
referenced it. If he came clean now, he would seem like a liar. Maybe she had confused
him with someone else. Maybe the fairies were involved. Anyway, he didn't want to
marry Linda Lin, who was gay, but Fred nodded and smiled and laughed. "Soon," he said.
"After midterms."

Feeling was beginning to return to Fred's fingers. It was getting late. He glanced
meaningfully at the brown bag on the counter. Ms. Lin, thankfully, picked up on the
glance, and, apologizing, handed him the bag. "Be safe!" she said. "Come by soon, okay?"

Fred put the order in the lime green box attached to his lime green rear rack and
pumped the lime green pedals into the dark night.

\*\*\*

Soon, Fred was rolling up to 202 Kingsford Place, his breath ragged after climbing the
final hill. At least he had warmed up a little. The building loomed above him, a
massive stone edifice that dominated the hillside. It was U-shaped, with a narrow
courtyard down the middle. A tall, iron gate separated the courtyard from the sidewalk.
There were no lights on in the whole building. Only the dim, flickering glow of a
nearby streetlight lit the scene. Even from the sidewalk, Fred could smell the decaying
wet leaves that were piled in the courtyard.

Fred wondered why he had never delivered here before. He had delivered all
over the whole city at this point, but never on Kingsford before and never at 202
Kingsford. It was strange; the rest of the buildings on the block had numbers in the
three thousands. This was the only building in the two hundreds. Fred was worried that
he was in some sort of time rift situation, this ancient building blinking briefly
into existence to capture its next victim before returning to the century it belonged.
If so, the fairies were certainly implicated. But this was foolish, wishful thinking.
The address was on Unlivery. The order was paid for and the tip was generous. The
fairies didn't tip. They also didn't use apps, Fred knew. Just a gloomy old building,
Fred thought. Only this and nothing more.

Fred got off his bike, took out the food, detached his phone, and walked up to the
gate. He tugged at the iron bars. It was locked. He looked around for a bell, but saw
none. There was a rusty knocker fashioned into a horned goat high in the center of the
gate, but Fred was sure that no one in the building would hear it. Oh, remembered Fred,
the instructions!

_At the gate's of hell grab the devil's beast and knock._ \
_Knock and knock thrice! Thrice! No more._ \
_Proven unworthy, the unliverer will be welcomed within._ \
_Push the gate gently and it
shall open wide._ \
_Through the courtyard stroll, quickly now, lest the noodles turn cold._ \
_Now turn left, never right--never, never right. A cellar door for you awaits._ \
_Down you go. Down! I smite thee down!_

The large tip was starting to make more sense. Fred was beginning to suspect that other
powers were at work. Darker and more primeval than the fae folk. The instructions went on
and on. Wind through the basement, up some stairs, down a hallway, left, left again, never right, down
some stairs, up again and again, and along another hallway, through a door and then
finally arriving at the apartment, always hurrying, always making sure the noodles
wouldn't get cold. Fred thought that the noodles would be much less likely to get cold
if the recipient would just come down to meet him at the front door. Some people could
be so lazy. But the tip was good. At least the tip was good.

Fred stretched up on his tiptoes to reach the knocker. He rapped it against the gate
three times. Thrice and no more! He pushed against the gate. It didn't budge. Struggling
to navigate the Unlivery app with his cold fingers, Fred pulled up the instructions
again. "...knock. Knock and knock thrice! Thrice! No more," it said. Fred was confused.
He had knocked thrice. But did he have to knock and then knock thrice more? Four knocks
total? Or once, twice and then three more for five? And maybe another thrice after that?
Who wrote this crap? The fairies were known to be ambiguous, but if they didn't want
cold noodles, they could have been more clear. Maybe they did want cold noodles. Who
would want cold lo mein? They could have ordered the sesame noodles.
Maybe it was the vampires. Maybe they were scheming to get a
refund. Those schemy, schemy bloodsuckers. Frustrated, Fred tugged at the gate. It opened
wide.

The instructions had said to push. He was sure of it. Fred was perplexed. What was
going on? What if it was a sasquatch taking a break from the woods? That would explain
a lot. They couldn't write though, at least nothing as complicated as the instructions.
Fred raced through the possibilities in his mind as he hurried through the basement,
brushing cobwebs out of his face. It was warm inside, but the chill remained deep in
Fred's bones.

Fred pushed open the basement door at the top of the stairs. A swarm of moths fluttered
into the light of his flashlight, their paper wings brushing lightly against his face.
Mothman? wondered Fred. No, Mothman wouldn't tip. It didn't make sense. None at all.

The first hallway was long and dark. Fred struggled to correlate the inside layout of the
building to the U-shape he had seen outside. He was always bad at that though. He got
lost in every subway station he ever went in. He double checked the instructions. The
lo mein still felt warm through the bag. It would all be okay, thought Fred. Probably not
vampires, he reassured himself. Not vampires. No, not vampires. Please not vampires.
Please. He quickened his pace, avoiding the stares of the pale faces in the portraits
that lined the walls. Okay, maybe vampires. Maybe it's vampires.

Fred didn't want to become a vampire. He was cold enough as it was.

Up now. Another long hallway. Down. Up again. He was close now. Something howled outside.
The newspapers said there were coyotes in the city now. Fred knew better. A mouse
skittered by underfoot. Fred jumped. He hoped the museum would get back to him soon.
He wondered if Unlivery had any policies regarding delivery to supernatural forces.
Maybe he could advise them on it. That would be a nice gig. A snake slithered past now,
chasing the mouse.

Witches! Fred realized. Must be witches! It would be okay. Fred could handle witches.
A coven of hungry witches was no problem. No problem at all. Fred pushed through a set
of swinging doors. At the end of the corridor was Apartment 322, a dim light casting
shadows from behind the door. Witches. It's witches. Fred was nervous though. What if
it was something worse? He tapped lightly at the door, his nervous fingers tapping gently
at the door. Witches. It's witches and nothing more.

The old building creaked and moaned in the echoing silence. No one came to the door.
Breathing deep to still the beating of his heart, Fred tapped again, some what louder
than before. Silence reigned.

At last, a deep, murmuring voice sounded from within the apartment. "Sir," it said, "or
Madam, truly your forgiveness..." It trailed off. Not witches then. The voice was too
deep.

There was another loud creak and the apartment door swung open. Fred screamed.

An old man stood in the doorway, squinting into the darkness, looking straight through
Fred. He looked tired and unkept. His nightgown was wrinkled. He reminded Fred of his
grandfather. Fred felt bad for screaming. He lifted the brown bag slightly and tried to
smile. "Sorry," he said. "I was just a little spooked. Here's your lo mein."

But the old man continued to peer into the darkness. He didn't seem to have heard the
scream or Fred's apology. He must be deaf. And half-blind, too. "Lenore?" he
whispered.

"Lenore?" said Fred, his voice rising. "No, it's Fred Lee. I have your order from Jade
Garden. Sir? Your lo mein, sir."

The man turned swiftly back into the apartment, leaving the door open wide behind him.
"Hello?" Fred said. "Sir! Your noodles, sir!"

He would have just left them at the door, but the sight of the old man puttering around
moved something in Fred. He must be hungry. Fred wanted to make sure he got his noodles.
He hoped that some day someone would make sure that he got his noodles when he was a
crazy old man. Gingerly, Fred stepped into the apartment, coming at once into what
must be the living room. A sputtering fire played on a small TV in the corner. Thick
books were strewn about haphazardly. The old man was at the far side of the room, bathed
in the moonlight that came streaming through a window. He continued to mutter to himself
as he pried open the window.

Fred was relieved. Maybe there aren't things that go bump in the night. Maybe his aunt
was right. He put the bag down on a small table and opened one of the boxes. Steam rose
pleasantly off the noodles. If the old man couldn't see or hear, maybe he could still
smell. Fred stepped out, quietly now. He didn't want to disturb the old man. He pulled
the door shut behind him. He leaned against the wall in the hallway and listened
for a while. He was a little disappointed that it wasn't witches. But at least it wasn't
vampires. He felt calmer than he had in a long time. Too long.

He heard the scrape of a chair and then the distinctive slurp of Ms. Lin's lo mein
being thoroughly enjoyed.

Fred realized how hungry he was. Too much frightful dreaming had worked up his appetite.
He checked the time. Jade Garden would still be open if he hurried. He hurried.
The building felt less scary now that he knew it was that harmless old man's home. It
could use an exterminator though. Maybe two exterminators. Outside the courtyard, his
bike was still there, as always.

When Fred neared Jade Garden, chilled to the bone once again, he was surprised to
see how dark the storefront was. Only the A's in the sign above the door were lit.
The windows were all boarded up. Fred was too shocked to even consider that the fairies
could be involved.

Just then, his phone buzzed. It was a notification from Unlivery: "Business finished!
Your last customer rated your delivery at 5 smiley faces! Thanks for all your hard work!"

At peace at last, Fred dissolved into the night, delivering no more.

 ˝èz*A story about noodles  unliveryA Dirge of Hope  ‰ﬁ
Every night before I get into the shower, I pluck a little ball of black lint out
of my belly button. This is a profund and routine act.

**Q:** _What do you do with the lint?_

**A:** I flick it into the trash can, or, if I'm lazy, I let it drop into the sink.

**Q:** _Why is putting it in the sink the lazier option?_

**A:** The trash can has a pedal-operated lid and is low to the ground. Operating it
requires movement of the legs and also some bending of the wrist to more accurately
flick the lint where it belongs.

**Q:** _Are you worried about clogging the sink drain?_

**A:** Not at all. It's really a very, very small amount of lint.

**Q:** _Then why not always flick it into the sink?_

**A:** I'm worried about clogging the drain.

**Q:**  _What are you even talking about?_

**A:** Belly button lint, the burden that must be borne by god's chosen people, innies.

**Q:** _Where does it come from?_

**A:** The slow unravelling of my t-shirts, one teeny tiny fiber at a time, just as
the world and time itself unravel too, the loose fibers of civilization daily collecting
in the belly button of Creation, death, which comes for us all.

**Q:** _Why is it black?_

**A:** Because my t-shirts are black.

**Q:** _All of them?_

**A:** Yes. I suffer from hyperhidrosis. Black hides the pit stains.

**Q:** _Does the belly button's rich symbolism--as the last vestige of the life-giving
connection to your mother, the cord which your father so cruelly cut and audaciously
tied, giving you unasked-for independence--does this symbolism ever bring you to your
knees, crying out in analytical agony on the bathroom floor as thread by thread your life
unwinds itself into your cold, sweaty hands?_

**A:** No, that would be silly, wouldn't it?

### INTERIOR Local Thrift Shop

_In the back of the dimly lit store, dull-eyed patrons flip
idly through a rack of disordered clothes. Two women chat near the
shoes, which are arranged neatly on a few shelves, but also heaped
haphazardly beneath the shelves. At the front, the_ CASHIER _hands
a heavy bag to a short_ OLD LADY _who then putters to the door.
Out the poster-covered windows, dusk is falling on a busy city street.
To the right of the door, a shirtless mannequin stands in the window
wearing corduroys and an Easter hat. As_ OLD LADY _reaches the door,_
PROTAGONIST _opens it._

_The bell chimes loudly._

PROTAGONIST _is a tweny-something tech bro: tall-ish, scruffy beard,
Allbirds, wrinkly khakis, puffy blue coat, Patagonia backpack, slightly sweaty.
His eyes adjusting to the darkness of the store, he nearly collides with_ OLD LADY.

PROTAGONIST: Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

OLD LADY _plows slowly onwards, unperturbed and unaware._

CASHIER: Hi! How are you?

PROTAGONIST: _(still startled)_ Hi. How's it going?

PROTAGONIST _turns quickly to the household goods section of the store.
A towering shelf is heaped with bowls and plates and candles
and candelabras and candle snuffers and spoons and mugs and caraffes
and oddly shaped glasses._

PROTAGONIST: _(to himself)_ Salt shaker, salt shaker, salt shaker...

_Stepping forward,_ PROTAGONIST _picks up a pepper grinder, thinks for a moment
and puts it back. He hurries outside._

### EXTERIOR Busy City Street

_A wide, Wes Anderson-style shot shows six or seven storefronts on a busy
city street. Pedestrians, cyclists and a bus pass by. To dramatic music,_
PROTAGONIST _appears from the door of Local Thrift Shop and hurries down the sidewalk
to Art Store._

### INTERIOR Art Store

_The store is brightly lit and neatly organized. Soft pop radio
plays over the speakers._

ART STORE EMPLOYEE: Hi, welcome! Can I help you find anything today?

PROTAGONIST: _(pretending not to be startled)_ Hi, thanks. No, I think I'm good.

PROTAGONIST _proceeds to pace the aisles with decreasing confidence. Canvasses,
paints, pens, glue, brushes, yarn, frames, posters, pencils, sketchbooks.
No salt shakers. He pauses for a while in the crafts section. Nothing.
At the front of the store is a gift section._ PROTAGONIST _circles it thrice.
He glances quickly at the cashier, clearly wondering what they would think
if he asked if they had any salt shakers. He shakes his head slightly and leaves._

### EXTERIOR Busy City Street

_Slightly wider shot. Same dramatic music. It's getting later._ PROTAGONIST
_hurries from Art Store to Camping Supply Store._

This is, (un)fortunately, where the screenplay ends. What becomes of
PROTAGONIST and whether he ever finds a salt shaker can only be imagined.

 ˝é`PThe extra bonus content no one asked for  salt-part-6SALT: The Movie  ¸QÜ
I had a bad month. Things didn't start to turn around until the day that I got hit by a car.

All my troubles began some time earlier, in the cold, sad depths of March. I was swiping my hopeless way through a dating app, as one does in the cold, sad depths of March, when I saw a profile of a woman who had recently through-hiked the Appalachian Trail. Cold and sad as I was, this seemed like a great idea: I would quit my job, or at least take 5 months off, and go into the woods. I matched with her and asked her some questions.

Soon, I realized that it would probably not be a good idea to embark on a 5 month long hike without any prior backpacking experience. I had hiked and I had camped but I had never hiked with my tent (and everything else) on my back. I had also never pooped in the woods. What if I realized that I didn't like it on the first of 150 days?

I texted a couple of my adventurous friends and we began to plan a three-day backpacking trip. This would offer me a brief taste of The Woods without making any insane decisions. If it went well, I could make the insane decision during the next bout of seasonal depression. If it went poorly, the damage would at least be confined to three days, right? Right? Wrong.

The trip was from Saturday June 29th to Monday July 1. Overall, it was a pretty good time. I did get some nasty blisters from my new boots, which, by the third day, prevented me from putting the boots on at all. Luckily, we only had a couple miles to go that day.
And I had sandals (I didn't need to wear my boots). We also got rained on one night. The lightning was so close that we could see it flash through the trees, through the tent and through our closed eyelids. Three inches of water pooled beneath the tent, but we stayed dry and didn't float away. My boots got wet though, which probably didn't help with the blisters. But still, overall, a positive experience. I don't think I was quite ready for 5 months, but it wasn't out of the question.

###### ![a quiet bend in a river, surrounded by lush greenery](assets/miseries/the-river.jpg)
<caption text="The gentle river beside our first night's campsite. I knew not what dangers lurked within." />

When we returned to civilization, I had received two texts from two women whom I had been dating/attempting to date. Both texts were perplexing and not at all positive. By the end of the month, both potential relationships had dissolved into nothing. Neither would have worked out anyway, but it feels germane to include here among my other miseries and misfortunes.

A couple days later, now back in Brooklyn, I noticed some pus coming out of one of my blisters. I was worried about it being a bad infection since I had stepped in some questionable bog water at some point during the hike. I hobbled over to Urgent Care and got a prescription for an antibiotic cream. That was Wednesday, July 3rd.

Nothing went wrong the following weekend. I actually had a great time. My blisters had healed.

On Tuesday, I went bouldering at the rock climbing gym and launched myself into a wall, re-injuring the ankle that I had sprained back in cold, sad March, in much the same way.

On Thursday, I had no appetite for lunch and a slight fever. On Friday and into Saturday, I had a high fever and no appetite. On Sunday, I dragged myself to brunch and then threw up on 14th Street. Three weeks of diarrhea followed.

Some days I felt better and thought it was almost over. Some days were worse. My best theory was that the fever was Covid and the bowel issues were Long Covid. I tried to run a couple times. The runs went very, very, poorly. I didn't leave the house much, but when I did, I planned my route from public bathroom to public bathroom.

After two weeks, I realized that I really wasn't getting any better and that any good days were followed fast by bad ones. I went to Urgent Care for the second time that month. They asked for a stool sample. I procured such, in the comfort of my own home, and then walked back to Urgent Care with said sample. How embarrassing.

It took the lab a whole week to get a positive result: I had giardia, a water-borne parasite, which commonly afflicts hikers who drink from dirty water. We had taken precautions: filtering and boiling and iodizing, but a couple little parasites must have slipped through my defenses. The fever wasn't Covid at all. The parasites had finished incubating and were announcing their presence.

###### ![The writer and four friends ready to embark on their hike, all smiles](assets/miseries/friends.jpg)
<caption text="blissfully unaware of what was to come" />

Luckily, there was a drug that would kill all the parasites in just three days. This was now Friday. I walked over to my local pharmacy during my lunch break to get the drugs. They didn't have any in stock, but could get it Monday. I didn't fancy suffering any longer, so I walked over to Walgreens to see if they had it. No dice.

I called CVS. They had it and could get it ready around 7pm. They would call when it was ready. I rejoiced.

At 6:30pm, it started pouring rain. At 7:15pm, the drugs were ready. CVS closed at 8pm. I decided to ride my bike over. I would get wet either way, but biking would greatly reduce my time away from a bathroom. Four blocks later, while I was riding in what counts as a bike lane in the U.S., there was a car stopped in the crosswalk of a side street, looking to make a left across me into the main road. I slowed down. The driver didn't make a move. I kept going. The driver made a move.

###### ![The writer standing in a sun-dappled forest](assets/miseries/in-the-woods.jpg)
<caption text="If you look closely here, you can see a man hurtling head-first into his destiny and elbow-first into a white sedan." />

I was essentially t-boned. Luckily, I was going slowly enough that I pretty much just fell on my left shoulder and didn't go flying over the handlebars or anything scary like that. Luckily, she was also going slowly and stopped immediately and
[wasn't an Artificial "Intelligence"](https://jalopnik.com/woman-hit-by-cruise-robotaxi-was-dragged-20-feet-1850963884) and
[wasn't driving a deadly oversized pickup truck or SUV](https://web.archive.org/web/20240104210734/https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/suvs-trucks-killing-pedestrians-cyclists/621102/).

She pulled over and got out to see if I was okay. My shin hurt a bit, but I felt okay.
Adrenaline is, as they say, one hell of a drug. In my shock, I didn't get the driver's
insurance or contact information. I didn't think I needed it. It's hard to make
good financial decisions in such circumstances. My chain had slipped off, but otherwise
my bike looked okay. I put the chain back on and tested the brakes. I may or may not
have screamed in rage. The driver had left by then. She looked more traumatized than I did.

I continued biking to the pharmacy with tears and rain streaming down my face. I made
it about 10 meters before I realized that my front wheel was wobbling. I stopped on the
sidewalk and inspected the bike. Indeed, the wheel was bent. Again, I might have screamed
and/or cried on the sidewalk. The pharmacy was now a 25 minute walk away. It would close in...
25 minutes. I considered ordering a Lyft, but I didn't trust them to get me there in time
either. I decided to get a CitiBike instead. One of the few good things that happened to
me on this day was that I got a 15-day CitiBike membership for only $5.

I made it to the CVS without anyone else hitting me with their car. I was soaking wet
and holding back tears. It hurt to stand on my left leg. I told the pharmacist my name
and he went to get the drugs. He placed them on the counter and pointed to the label,
saying, "Are you aware of the co-pay?"

I read the label. The drugs were $243.

I asked if there were any coupons. He said that there were, but it would be
the same price with the coupons. I asked if I could dispute it with my insurance
after paying for them. He said that I had 7 days after purchase to do so. Or, he
offered helpfully, the pharmacy could hold on to the drugs for up to 14 days
while I begged my insurance company (United Healthcare in this case, but fuck them
all in general) to not make me pay over $200 for an antibiotic so that I could
stop having diarrhea every day. (Like, what the fuck is the fucking insurance for!)
The pharmacist did not know what I had been through to get these drugs. I
paid for them because I'm lucky to be able to afford them and also what the fuck
else was I going to do?

I barely made it out of the CVS before bursting into tears. I sobbed my way
over to the river-front park next to the CVS. The rain had stopped and
there was a beautiful, dramatic sunset over Manhattan. I lay down on a bench,
right in a puddle and cried for a little while. I considered jumping into
the East River for a little swim. What was the worst that could happen? Giardia 2?

###### ![A beautiful sunset over the East River](assets/miseries/sunset.jpg)
<caption text="Giardia 2?" />

I took a Lyft back to the corner where I had locked up my bike, bought some Oreos
and limped home. I collapsed on the couch. The adrenaline was wearing off and
I was doing Very Much Not Okay. Frances, my roommate, cooked me dinner. She's a
real one for real. It was the best unseasoned tofu and noodles I had had all week.

---

That was pretty much the end of it. The drugs kicked in quickly.
My shin hurt like crazy on Saturday, but when I went to Urgent Care (my
third time in 30 days), they assured me that it wasn't fractured. I could
walk after all. It's perfectly healed now. I'm slowly putting the weight I lost
back on and re-building my stamina. I'm no longer too keen on a 5-month
long hike that would involve drinking more river water. So it goes.

Getting a new front wheel for my bike cost about $60. Cheaper than a funeral.

I sort of thought that bad things would stop happening to me, at least for a
little while. I thought the universe owed me a break. But if there really is
some universal balance, who am I to think that my bad month would make the slightest dent
in the cosmic calculus? I lost my keys two weeks later.

One friend who heard me tell this story accused me of doing it all for
the blog. He's wrong, but as AJR said, "100 bad days make a 100 good stories;
100 good stories make me interesting at parties." So where the wave at? I
could use a drink.

Later, I was in Italy with some friends, all of whom knew about the
salt shaker and the iodine and my itchy scalp and all the rest. We spent
three nights in Rome and four in Florence. Recall
now that the salt shaker [pictured in SALT I](/salt-part-1) was purchased
in Venice.

Rome had no salt shaker to offer me. There was not, to my disappointment,
a Coliseum-shaped salt shaker in the Coliseum gift shop. The Vatican Museum
had none in the shape of the Pope's head. Neither was there a salt shaker anywhere in
Trastevere. All of Rome, it seems, must be suffering unknowingly from
hyperthyroidism.

Ditto for Florence.

On our last day in Florence, we decided to take a day trip by train to Venice.
Once there, I went into the first gift shop that I saw. My friends walked along
without me.

And I found it! There it was on a bottom shelf in all its colorful Venetian glory. And for only ‚Ç¨15!
I paid and caught up with my friends.

\*\*\*

We spent an idyllic day strolling through the streets, looking at art and old buildings. At around 5:30pm, we decided to hire a gondola for a sunset boat ride. The gondolier said he could take us out for an hour and drop us off at Piazza San Marco. Our train back to Florence would leave at 7:05pm and the train station was some distance from the piazza, but no one did the math.

The gondola ride was relaxing beyond belief. The lapping of the water, the chatter of tourists on the street, the absence of noisy cars. Five friends in a boat at dusk. What more could a person need?

When we disembarked, we learned that we were now a 45 minute walk from the train station from which our train would leave in 25 minutes. This math we were capable of. We had negative 20 minutes to spare.

"We have to run," said Estelle. "Let's go."

And so we ran, winding our way through Venice's winding, twisting alleys,
dodging and weaving through crowds of tourists. Venice is the calmest, most
peaceful city I have visited. There are no cars honking, no trucks, no harried
businessmen. The tourists who overwhelm the city have nowhere to be. (Well, except for
us.) They stroll. They amble. They putz.

In New York, if one is late for a train and running along the sidewalk, one will
likely be passed by dozens of others who seem to be walking casually. In New York,
five young adults of various ethnic backgrounds running through the street is
unremarkable. In Venice, we were a spectacle.

At one point I was bringing up the rear when we entered a wide plaza. As we passed
one group of startled (American) tourists, I heard one woman say to her friend, "Watch
your purse! Watch your purse!"

As if we had time to steal anyone's purse! We had a train to catch!

I wonder if her reaction would have been better or worse if we had put the white guy in front.

Sweating and out of breath, we made it onto the train. It left as soon as we sat down.
My new salt shaker was still intact.

\*\*\*

I don't know exactly what that story has to do with the salt shaker, but I think
it's a good one. I think of it often when I'm shaking my salt shaker.

Deeper connections and hidden meanings are left as an exercise to the reader, but
I'll start you off with this one: be stupid. Don't order a salt shaker from Amazon
or Etsy. Go into stores that don't sell salt shakers and ones with 2 milliliter salt
shakers and ask dumb questions of souvenir shop employees and don't do any math before
getting into a gondola.

Nine days after I shattered the Goodwill salt shaker (and my dreams of easy iodization with it), some friends and I took a weekend trip to New York City.
On Saturday night, we got dinner in Chinatown and then, just the slightest bit tipsy
from our Tsingtaos, we began walking uptown towards Little Italy to our next activity.
On the southern limits of Little Italy is one of those I <3 NY
souvenir shops. Its blazing white LED lights beckoned from across the street.

"Hey," I said. "Do you guys mind if we stop at that store? I need a salt shaker."

I may or may not have already explained the whole situation to one or more of these friends, but before I could start, the pedestrian signal changed. "There's no time to explain!" I exclaimed.

I don't know what I love more: taking a really long time to explain something (q.v.
this blog series) or saying "Quick! There's no time to explain!"

My friends were happy enough to go poke around in the store without an explanation.

Miraculously, one friend found a salt shaker in the back of the store. He called
me over excitedly. The store's proprietors, meanwhile, were trying to convince one of
the native New Yorkers to buy a t-shirt. It wasn't going well.

The souvenir salt shaker was shaped like a yellow taxi. It was great--unique, full of
personality, whimsical enough, not cracked or grimy, and able to hold more than
two grains of salt. The only problem was that it came in a set with a pepper shaker.
The whole package cost $29.99. I didn't want the pepper shaker (black pepper is my
least favorite spice and, by the way, is entirely undeserving of its esteemed place on the American
dinner table). $30 seemed like a steep price for just a salt shaker. Besides, it had been
some time since my quest began and my skill at pouring salt from the 1-pound container
was slowly improving. At this point, I was willing to be picky. I got the attention of
one of the store's employees and asked if I could just buy the salt shaker for $15.

He refused in a way that suggested he was unwilling to negotiate. On the other
side of the store, the t-shirt discussion was growing more heated. It was time to leave.

\*\*\*

The next morning, I got brunch with two other friends, ones that hadn't been there the
previous night. I hadn't seen them in a long time. We greeted each other enthusiastically.

"Hello! Long time no see," I said. "How have you been?"

"I know!" said Sharanya. "I've been good!"

"Yes, so good to see you," said Brianne. "How have you been?"

"Great question," I said. "Let's decide what to eat first."

We ordered and then I told them the whole long story about my scalp and the salt and
all the rest. We talked about other things too, I'm sure.

After we finished eating, I asked them if they had plans for the rest of the day.
They didn't and my train wasn't for another few hours. They agreed to come along and
help me find a salt shaker.

Looking back now, we definitely didn't plan this part very well. We only made it
to two thrift shops and one of those was actually a vintage store, entirely devoid
of any sort of household goods. We probably should have gone to a more thrift-shop-dense
neighborhood. If only, if only. Needless to say, I did not find a salt shaker. Alas, alas,
alas.

\*\*\*

The salt shaker was by now starting to become more abstract. It was now less
of a quest and more of an activity, something to do with friends. I clearly didn't want
one _that_ badly... One wonders if Ahab really wanted to catch the whale... Was he really
just looking for something to kill time, an excuse to hang out with Queequeg? I don't
know; I haven't read the book.

The next day at 5:50pm, I found myself in Central Square, yet again.
Funny how I kept doing that. Note that on the second day of my quest, I only had
ten minutes before all the stores except Target closed, half as much time as
the first day. I had gravely miscalculated and gotten sucked into something at work.
Oh well. This journey was never meant to be easy.

I hustled across the street and down the block. I hustled into the Goodwill, almost
shouldering the employee who was guarding the door. She told me that they were
closing in just a few minutes. I told her that I'd be quick. She seemed doubtful,
but I didn't have time to explain. Maybe I'll send her a link to this story.

I hustled to the back of the store where they keep the non-clothing items. I tried
not to breathe in too strongly, not wanting any more of that particular Goodwill
fragrance in my nose than was necessary. (A good candle flavor to gift to your enemies,
in case you need any ideas. If they complain, ask them why they don't support charities.)
Summoning my I Spy skills again, I scanned the shelves and--lo! There it was. It
was hideous. It was cylindrical, about three inches tall and made of clear plastic.
It was absolutely devoid of personality or whimsy. I scratched my head as I deliberated.

I needed the iodine. And it was only three dollars. Yes, it wasn't at all what I was
looking for, but there was no reason it would mean the end of my search. I could get
iodized and continue looking for a salt shaker at my leisure. It was now 5:57pm.
I hastened to the checkout. Mission accomplished, sort of.

When I returned home, I brandished the salt shaker jubilantly to my disinterested
roommates. (They had been following the drama as it unfolded, more or less.)
Carter made a face when I said that it was from Goodwill. Steven pointed out that
there was some grime along the ridges inside the shaker.

"Oh, gross," I said. "I guess I should clean it."

"Yeah, for sure," agreed Carter and Steven.

I pulled off the cover from the bottom and began cleaning the salt shaker in the sink
with soap and water. The hole from which I had removed the cover, the one designed to
pour salt into when filling/re-filling the shaker, was pretty small. It was difficult to
get the sponge inside to scrub the sides. But the whole bottom part of the shaker
looked like it was sort of threaded into the rest of the shaker. I thought I could
remove it. Putting one finger into the hole, I pulled and twisted at the bottom
of the shaker. With a crack, it separated.

"Oops," I said.

One of my roommates may or may not have asked what had happened. I probably explained
anyway.

The bottom was definitely not supposed to come off in the way that it had. Looking
closely, I could see the jagged edges of broken plastic along the perimeter of the disk.
It was possible, though, to sort of snap it back into place. Maybe all hope was not yet lost.

I finished cleaning the shaker and dried it thoroughly. I snapped the bottom on and off
a few times. It seemed secure enough.

"Okay, I'm going to try it," I announced. "I might get salt everywhere."

#### ![A picture of the salt shaker, an ugly, mirthless thing](assets/salt2.png)

I got salt everywhere. All hope was lost.

I emptied the rest of the salt into the sink and tossed the shaker sadly into the
recycling bin. I had found and purchased the only reasonably-sized, refillable salt shaker
in Central Square and ruined it in less than an hour.

The hunt continued...

The next day after work, I found myself (purposefully) in Central Square, Cambridge. It was approximately 5:40pm. It was time to buy a salt shaker. How hard could it be? (Remember, reader, the salt shaker pictured in Part 1 is from Venice.)

My first stop was at the art supply store. I thought they might have some sort of salt shaker crafting kit thing. Did they? No. Does such a thing even exist? Who knows. Should it? Maybe...

I was too embarrassed to ask for help. I scoured the aisles. I passed an employee twice. "Do you need any help?" she asked. I did need help, obviously. "No thanks," I said. "I'm good." I wasn't good. I hurried out.

Stop number two made more sense, but was no more successful: a local thrift shop. They had a whole section for household goods in the front corner. I stood there for several minutes, letting my eyes adjust to the store's darkness and trying to discern what strange assortment of objects sat on the shelves. It reminded me of doing an I Spy puzzle, searching for four blue bunnies with such ferocious intent that the rest of the things in the puzzle are reduced to an incomprehensible blur. Everything was either a bunny or not a bunny, salt shaker or not salt shaker. It was a store full of not salt shakers. There was a nice pepper grinder though, so the end of my search seemed tantalizingly within reach. But they don't iodize black pepper (should they?). I left.

I should mention here that I grew up in a home rich in salt shakers. There was one silver one that my mother had borrowed from a fancy restaurant where she had worked in college. The top half was a salt shaker and the bottom half was a pepper grinder. Besides this one, there were several matching pairs of salt and pepper shakers: hugging bears, pigs (not hugging), Santa and an elf (also not hugging; for Christmas), colorful eggs (for Easter), a pair of pumpkins (for--oh, you get it), ...

I'm making it seem like these salt and pepper shakers were a big part of my childhood, that my family was weird about or like obsessed with them, but honestly, I assure you, it wasn't really a thing. We were normal about them. They were a simple fact of life.

But so now I had been cast harshly into cruel, un-iodized adulthood. And so, of course, given this resplendent upbringing, I had high expectations of my first salt shaker. I wanted something with personality, with verve, with a story. That is why my first stop was the arts supply store. Does it make sense now? Do you not now comprehend the delicate machinations of my mind? Should a salt shaker not be more than a mere shaker of salt?!

My third stop was the camping goods store. I had lost my social anxiety somewhere in the thrift shop. I walked straight to the counter, only stopping briefly to check the price of hiking socks (too high). I told the man at the counter the object of my quest. With only a slight hesitation, he pulled a salt shaker from the wall behind him. It was designed for backpacking trips, he explained. I examined it. It could probably have held three, maybe four grains of salt.

I told the man that I was looking for something bigger. He said that this was the only one they had and to maybe try the hardware store down the block. But, alas, it was now 5:58pm. I would never make it before they closed.

Dejected, I trudged across the street into Target. _Fine, I'll settle for a boring one for now, but keep my eyes peeled for one with more personality,_ I thought. In the spice aisle, the only salt shaker available was the kind that is impossible to refill. I didn't want to have to buy a new one every few months. I went into the basement to check the kitchen section (the Target basement, not my own (it's one of those tiny city Targets with two floors of products that aren't the ones you need)). No luck in the basement.

How far has our society plunged into madness for an honest man to be unable to purchase a reasonably-sized, refillable salt shaker, perhaps one in the shape of a whimsical woodland creature?! And why did all the stores except Target close at 6pm? What is wrong with this world?

Deep in thought, I walked home, scratching my head as I went.

###### ![A beautiful, rainbow-hued stained-glass salt shaker](assets/salt.png)

The other day, my roommate Frances was refilling the salt shaker and, unprompted, complimented it. "This is such a nice salt shaker," she said.

Like anyone, I was thrilled to have a product that I had purchased receive recognition for its beauty, but I was especially excited because of the long backstory behind this particular product. "Thanks," I said. "I got it in Venice."

"Oh," Frances said, not fully understanding.

"It's a long story," I added. "You'll have to read about it on my blog."

Here goes.

\*\*\*

```
Dermatologist: Hi, I'm Dr. Skin.
Me: Hi, nice to meet you.
Dr. Skin: So, tell me about your skin.
Me: It's bad, but it mostly fits.
```

That's not quite how my dermatologist appointment went, but it was pretty close. I was in for a litany of reasons, one of which was red, crusty eyelids. When I told the doctor about this symptom, she asked if I also had dandruff. "Yes," I explained. "That's one of the seven other problems."

Apparently, crusty red eyelids are comorbid with dandruff. I had been suffering from dandruff for about a year and a half. The crusty eyes were a more recent development. I was prescribed super extra strength anti-dandruff shampoo, plus a steroidal cream, plus plenty of other drugs and ointments for the other problems.

The cream worked for my eyes, but the shampoo seemed to only make things worse. Around this time, my itchy scalp was starting to drive me insane ([exhibit a](/itch)). Disappointed by the modern pharmaceutical industry, I resolved to take matters into my own hands. As I said, I have been plagued by an itchy scalp for about a year and a half. Incidentally, I had also moved into a new apartment a year and a half prior. My immediate conclusion was that my new roommate, Carter, was giving me dandruff. My mother, rational as always, suggested that it might be the new couch instead. "How could Carter give you dandruff?" she asked. "That's crazy."

I had bought the couch used ([see here for more](/modern-commerce)) from a friend of a friend who had bought it from another friend who had owned cats. I am sometimes allergic to certain cats. Maybe it was the couch. Maybe my mother was right.

I forswore the couch for a fortnight. I did not lay, sit, nap, lounge, rot, relax, or sprawl out on the couch. It was a hard two weeks; my scalp remained itchy.

I tried a variety of other potential solutions, to no avail. Then, one fateful night, while I was cooking dinner, reaching into Carter's fancy salt container for a pinch of fancy sea salt, I came to a sudden realization: it _was_ Carter's fault all along. Since moving in with him, I had been using his fancy sea salt (which he shared generously), unlike at previous apartments where one roommate or another had a refillable salt shaker that we filled with regular, non-flaky, non-fancy salt. I hypothesized that my dandruff was the result of an iodine deficiency. A while ago, a friend had shown me a cool video about iodine deficiency and hyperthyroidism and how the salt industry had basically solved it in one of the biggest public health victories since sliced bread by iodizing table salt. However, the video had warned, iodine deficiency is back on the rise as flaky, un-iodized sea salt becomes more trendy. I also knew that I wasn't getting much iodine in my almost-vegan diet. So, switching to Carter's fancy salt had removed my last significant source of iodine. I felt my thyroids nervously. Were they swollen?

They seemed fine. And my brief attempt at research (8 searches on duckduckgo) did not yield any studies claiming a correlation of scalp itchiness to iodine deficiency. And yet...

So, I decided to start cooking with iodized salt. Even if it didn't cure my dandruff, it would save my thyroids. I'm quite fond of having normal sized thyroids. Incidentally, my other roommate, Steven, owned and cooked with iodized salt. Steven, however, is a simple man. He has no use for such frivolities as refillable salt shakers. When salting his eggs or chicken, he simply pours out salt from the 1-pound cylinder of iodized salt with a deft hand, straight into the pan. My hand was not so deft. I grossly over salted whatever meal I was cooking at the time.

I needed a salt shaker, one to refill with iodized salt and cure my dandruff. Thus began my quest.

 ˝ç® The quest begins  salt-part-1SALT I  Ó.
_Written on August 10, 2022_

One of my good friends from high school died by suicide in
May. It feels like I just got the call yesterday.
I was in the middle of cleaning my room. I still
haven‚Äôt finished sweeping.

Greg was a terrific friend. He was brave and kind and
he knew how to quack like a duck. We would be
in the middle of some serious conversation about girls or college or
life and he would quack. Sometimes he would interrupt himself with
a quack, start giggling, then turn serious, apologize,
and then quack and giggle all over again.

I was shocked when I got the call, but, sadly,
not entirely surprised. Greg suffered from treatment-resistant depression for
many years. One night after a party in high school,
he attempted suicide. I don‚Äôt remember very well what
happened after that. I don‚Äôt think we talked about it enough.

I don‚Äôt think I have talked about his death enough
either. I told my boss because I needed a few days
off of work, but none of my other co-workers.
I told a few of my friends from college, but not
all of them. So, here I am, on the
internet, talking about the death of my friend from suicide.

In elementary school, Greg and I played on the same soccer
team. I liked him. He was one of the only
kids from a different school that I invited to my birthday parties.
One year, the whole team signed up for a 5K race.
It was the longest I had ever run. I finished in
just over 27 minutes. Greg smoked us all with a sub-22 finish.

As a J.V. goalie, Greg saved dozens of
goals. He would throw himself at the ball without any care
onto the rocky field. He would end the games bruised and
scraped and grinning. As an organ donor, Greg saved five lives.

Quack.

If it were a non-mental illness that got him,
one we understand better, like cancer, then it might have
been easier. There might have been less guilt. There might
have been some goodbyes. It‚Äôs hard, though,
to tell someone that you have terminal depression. With cancer,
it‚Äôs easy to prove that you‚Äôve exhausted your
options. You can do chemo and surgery and all the other
drugs and treatments and then you die and then they say that
the cancer got you. With depression, it seems like there‚Äôs
always one last treatment you could try that would make it not
so terminal. When depression gets you, they say you did it yourself.

Quack.

 ˝çñHSome words on the death of my friend  gregGreg  ¸qä
#### ![A drawing of four mushrooms](assets/dragon/mushrooms.png)

Deep in the shadowed valleys of the Dark Mountains, in a deep, umbral cave,
there lived a dragon. The dragon slept, mostly. The dragon snored, too. In the
depths of its slumber, in the depths of its cave, the dragon exhaled small
wisps of flame, which flame briefly illuminated the deep darkness of the cave,
which cave would then glitter in the darkness, glitter with gold in the
darkness. Gold of all kinds and all shapes neatly lined little shelves on the
cave walls. In the middle of the cave was a great mound of gold: coins,
goblets, bars, ingots, statues, crowns, idols, diadems and daggers. On top of
this pile was a giant memory foam mattress. On top of the mattress, the dragon.
On top of the dragon, sheets of gold thread.

The dragon had been amassing its wealth for many long aeons. Its first batch of
gold was stolen from the dwarves who had been foolishly mining in the Dark
Mountains, ignorant of the proximal dragon. After this initial conquest,
having acquired a taste for gold‚Äîand flesh (the dragon had previously
subsisted on the Dark Mountains' abundant bounty of mushrooms)‚Äîthe dragon
embarked on raids farther and farther from its cave. It seized upon lone
travelers, royal caravans, tiny hamlets and bustling villages. After each
success, the dragon piled its winnings into a huge net and flew back to the
cave clutching the net with its feet. Once home, the dragon picked out its
favorite treasures to go on the shelves; the rest was dumped onto the central
heap. Sometimes the dragon brought back leftovers, too, to re-heat later.
These were stored in the snowbank just beyond the cave.

The dragon's infamy spread throughout the land, spurring brave and/or foolish
knights to journey into the Dark Mountains to slay the dragon. The dragon
killed and ate them all with terrifying nonchalance. Conveniently, these
intrepid knights usually carried purses full of coin, allowing the dragon
to steadily increase its wealth while going on fewer business trips.

And so it was for a long, long time. The dragon grew very, very wealthy. It
slept peacefully on its mound of gold in the dark cave, content and satisfied.

But then one day there was a loud knock at the cave's entrance, followed by a
loud shout: "Hello! Dragon? Anybody home?"

The dragon stirred unhappily in its sleep. Would-be dragon slayers usually
crept in through the back entrance, hoping to slit the dragon's throat while
it slept (Ha! As if their puny swords could pierce the dragon's thick scales!).
The dragon was thus unaccustomed to visitors announcing their presence. The
dragon was wary.

"Hello! Dragon?" called the voice again.

"Who's there?" said the dragon, its voice hoarse from sleep, yet still tinged
with fire.

"It's Steve," said the voice.

"Steve who?" said the dragon.

"Steve Pardeux from Chovia Investments. I'm a financial adviser. Do you have
a few minutes to discuss your plan for successful wealth management?"

"What?" said the dragon. It was still half asleep.

Steve Pardeux thought for a minute. "Do you want more gold?" he asked.

Now the dragon was awake. "Yes," it said. It quickly shrugged off its nightcap
and sat upright in bed. "Do come in," the dragon purred.

Steve entered the cave slowly, cautiously toeing the ground in front of him
before each step. It was dark in the dark cave in the Dark Mountains. His
hands were raised defenselessly. The dragon blew a quick burst of flame into
the brazier, which ignited instantly with a roar. Steve blinked hard in the
sudden brightness. He now approached the dragon with more confidence, but
still with arms upraised.

In the flickering light, the dragon studied this strange stranger. His brown
leather shoes were caked with mud. Their frayed laces were no longer up to the
task; thin vines of ivy were tied around the mid-soles, holding the shoes
together. His thin navy blue pants were riddled with holes, pierced by thorns
and spotted with patches of icy snow. His brown leather belt was in
remarkably good shape. So was his thin yellow tie. His white button-up, though,
was no longer white. Soon it would no longer be much of a shirt. His navy blue
jacket matched the pants. If the dragon had seen Steve when he started out
from the branch, it would have been impressed by his fanciful garments. Not so
much anymore. _What fool is this to journey through the Dark Mountains to my
cave without a full suit of armor or at least a decent coat?_ thought the
dragon.

#### ![An illustration of Steve approaching the dragon on its mattress](assets/dragon/on-the-mattress.png)

Steve Pardeux, M.B.A., the fool in question, took four more steps into the
cave, stopping at the edge of the pile of gold. He slowly lowered his hands.
The dragon noticed how cold he looked. His hands and face and even his scalp,
which showed through his balding, close-cut hair, were bright red. _Perhaps I
should warm him up,_ thought the dragon.

"Hi," Steve began. "Pleased to meet you."

_Meat,_ thought the dragon. It licked its lips.

"I came all this way," Steve said quickly, gesturing first at his rags and then
out beyond the cave‚ÄîSteve liked to talk with his hands‚Äî"all this long way
because I thought that you would be interested in earning more gold than you
ever dreamed of. You do like gold, right?"

The dragon wiped the drool off its chin. "Hmm," it said. "Gold? Tell me more."

"Well," Steve Pardeux, M.B.A., explained, "there are businesses all throughout
the land that need some small amount of gold to get started and then once they
have it, they can use it to make things that they can sell, turning the initial
gold‚Äîan investment, if you will‚Äîinto more and more gold. If you, Dragon,
provide this initial sum, the businesses will share part of the gold they make
with you. You can use your gold to make more gold."

The dragon had several questions. But first, it dug a golden throne out of the
pile and offered it to Steve, who, much relieved, sat. Then the dragon fetched
its favorite tea set from a shelf and made a pot of tea. And then it rested
its massive head on its foreclaws and listened to Steve explain the basics of
free market capitalism. The dragon was an attentive student and asked many
astute questions. Sometimes, though, its mind would wander and its stomach
would rumble. In these cases, Steve Pardeux would calmly remind the dragon of
their shared objective: more gold. This seemed to work. At some point, the
dragon roasted some mushrooms for dinner. With his belly full and his body
warmed inside and out by the tea and brazier, Steve became more eloquent and

The dragon, however, remained skeptical for some time; it didn't want to give
up any of its gold, even under a guarantee that it would get the gold back‚Äî
and more! But now Steve explained that Chovia Investments was willing to make
the dragon a loan using the gold as collateral. The vast pile would remain
untouched (unless the market totally collapsed, but that was highly, highly
unlikely, Steve insisted, nothing to worry about at all). Steve could see the
dragon was warming up to the idea. He was excited. His co-workers back at the
branch would never believe the size of his commissions.

"Now then," said Steve, "if you'll allow me to step out for a few minutes to
grab my things, I would love to go over some options for your investment
strategy."

"Of course," said the dragon. "Here, take this." It handed Steve a golden
lantern and placed a glowing ember from the brazier within.

Steve walked briskly out of the cave and returned a few minutes later pushing
a cheap looking desk in front of him with his left hand and pulling an
ethernet cable, a phone line and an extension cord over his shoulder with his
right. On the desk were a lantern, a desktop computer, a corded telephone and
several Chovia Investments branded pens and notepads. A few of these branded
items fell off the desk as Steve rolled it across the bumpy cave floor. Steve
maneuvered the desk in front of his throne and sat down. He fiddled with the
wires and the computer. The dragon was confused, and, in his confusion, hungry
again. _What is this strange man doing?_ it thought. _I wonder what M.B.A.
tastes like,_ it wondered.

Steve pulled a projector from a desk drawer and jumped back into his pitch
with gusto, and now, visual aids. He showed the dragon colorful charts of the
stock market's growth over the long term. He explained how, in the long term,
and small dips were drowned out by the continual march of progress and
profitability, that steady and reliable drumbeat of capitalism. He explained
that for an immortal dragon, the long term meant essentially unbounded wealth,
whole mountains hollowed out and filled with gold. The dragon tried to pay
attention, but it was mesmerized by the beautiful light of the projector
dancing on the cave wall. "I'm sold," it said. "Where do I sign?"

Steve Pardeux smiled and pulled out a stack of papers from another drawer.
He handed the dragon a corporate pen. "Here," he said. "and here and here
and initial here and here and a signature here and..."

At last, they shook, hand to claw.

The dragon tore off a corner of its mattress and set it up for Steve in a
sub-cave off to the left. Steve promised to get a start first thing in the
morning as soon as the markets opened. Then, satisfied and pleased with
themselves, they both fell sound asleep.

#### ![An illustration of several cables and wires trailing out of the dragon's dark cave](assets/dragon/cave.png)

In the morning, as promised, Steve made some phone calls and began fleshing
out the dragon's portfolio. The market had been down, but Steve knew that it
was the perfect time to buy. His intuition soon proved correct and the dragon's
wealth began to swell.

Steve and the dragon settled in to a comfortable life together in the cave and
sub-cave, growing fat on mushrooms, watching the numbers get bigger and bigger.
The numbers, Steve had to remind the dragon every so often, represent gold.
From time to time, Steve even took some of the dragon's dividends and bought
various gold trinkets with them, on behalf of the dragon. With his own
commissions, Steve had a new suit delivered and even splurged on grocery
delivery once, even though the fees were outrageous. _Dark Mountain surcharge?_
thought Steve. _What a rip-off!_

But then one day, years later, the market took a sharp turn for the worse,
sharper and worse than any previous turn Steve could recall! Steve only had
two weeks before he owed the dragon his annual report‚Äîthey had been seeing
each other less and less these days. For the first week, Steve did nothing
but pace around his sub-cave and hit refresh on his Bloomberg Terminal,
hoping the lines would bounce back up. The Journal, though, was forecasting
the worst. Chovia Investments itself risked going belly-up. Lay-offs were
imminent. The government was no help, distracted as it was by the wyrms in
the East. Also, the elves and the goblins had, somehow, set aside their
differences and were threatening open rebellion. Things were bad; the dragon
was far, far in the red.

Steve Pardeux, M.B.A., financial adviser to and wealth manager of dragons, was
usually calm under pressure. Had his hands shaken when he entered the cave all
those years ago? Had his voice quivered? Not an inch. Not a syllable. But now,
now Steve panicked. With only a week to get things back on track, Steve made
riskier and riskier bets. He leveraged and un-leveraged and re-leveraged. He
consolidated and diversified and put and called and danced and wiggled. He
finally paused for breath, only an hour before the meeting, and added (or,
rather, subtracted) everything up. Steve quickly realized that it was over.
The dragon's debts had piled up higher than the tallest of the Dark Mountains.
It was a hole there was no climbing out of. The markets were in absolute
shambles. Steve Pardeux expected everyone to give up on the whole damned thing
tomorrow. He took a deep breath, put on his best tie‚Äîthe yellow one he had
arrived in‚Äîand went off to tell the dragon the bad news.

"It's bad," Steve began. He explained, as best he could, the dire situation.
He maintained a calm, measured tone throughout until he got to the part about
the‚Äî"‚Äîthe‚Äîdare I say‚Äîcriminal, nay, immoral, unprecedented,
incomprehensible, nay, evil, evil inaction of the Fed! And notwithstanding the
goblin-elf situation, or the wyrms, but notwithstanding any of it! And
meanwhile‚Äî _meanwhile_ ‚ÄîChovia Investments! How dare they! Part ways? Pursue
other opportunities elsewhere!? Bah! I'm the only financial adviser to dragons
they'll ever get! Mismanaged funds? I'll show them mismanaged funds! Not
enough time in the office? How would they like to commute through the Dark
Mountains? How would they like it if their oxfords fell apart at the seams and
they had to tie them back together with vines! And meanwhile the Fed sits on
their pretty little hands! Their pretty little manicured hands going numb from
being sat on all day long. Bah!"

Steve continued in this manner for some minutes, his flailing arms casting wild
shadows all about the cave.

Eventually, the dragon pieced together that the lines had started to go the
wrong way and that Steve was no longer allowed to try to make them go the
right way. The dragon wasn't much bothered by this. Sure, the lines had looked
nice and Steve had always promised mountains of gold just within reach if he
was patient enough (and the immortal dragon could certainly wait), but all the
dragon had really ended up with was a few more trinkets. _Oh well,_ it thought.
_I guess that's that._

"Hold still a moment," said the dragon quietly.

"What?" said Steve, pausing.

The dragon roared a pillar of flame straight at Steve, roasting him to
medium-well. In two bites, the dragon gobbled him up, tie and all. A few weeks
later, the debt collectors arrived to seize the dragon's collateral. The dragon
ate them too.

\*\*\*

### Morals:

1. Ensure you have the means to seize collateral before making a loan.
2. A healthier mix of bonds and foreign stock can keep a portfolio afloat
during times of market turmoil.
3. The United States' abandonment of the gold standard in 1971 was a deadly
mistake.

 ˝çlA fairy tale  dragon*Steve Pardeux, M.B.A.  Ú
So I was going for a walk the other day, right? And maybe I had taken an edible
before I left‚Äîone of those gummy ones‚Äîgrowing up I used to think the default
edible was a brownie, but now it's all about these gummy ones‚ÄîI guess they're
easier to get the dose right for and keep longer and economies of scale and
regulation and all that, but still, it'd be nice to be able to buy a proper
old-fashioned special brownie from, like, the bakery‚Äîbut there I was on the
walk and maybe the gummy edible had started to kick in or maybe I was just
feeling very calm and at peace with the world without the aid of mind altering
substances, maybe it was the cool breeze on my face and the gentle lapping of
the river that had altered my mind, but I was almost home, so it had probably
been long enough for it to really have been the edible. Everything felt slow
and calm and relaxed-like. I had to cross one more bridge and then I'd
basically be home and so I was taking my time, strolling along. Now I had just
gotten onto the bridge, but I wasn't yet at the part of the bridge that goes
over the river. See, the bridge starts at street level and rises slowly and
then crosses over a highway and then over a strip of park and then finally
over the river. So I'm walking on the gradually ascending part of the bridge
and to my right a little bit away is a big brick wall. The wall isn't
free-standing or anything like that; it's attached to a building like normal,
but it doesn't have any windows, at least no perceivable windows. Maybe it has
teeny tiny windows that I never noticed. But this wall's maybe five or six
stories tall and real wide and it's got this huge mural on it, but that's not
really important to the story at all. The mural, that is. The wall is
important, but the mural on it isn't. It's a nice mural, one that I enjoy
looking at in general, but on this day while I was walking over the bridge,
it wasn't the mural on the wall that I was looking at, but something else. You
see, the sun was setting over to my left while I was walking over the bridge,
casting (the sun was) long shadows over to the right while I walked forward
over this gradually ascending part of the bridge. The sun was casting long
shadows onto the wall to my right. So I was walking over the bridge and my
shadow was walking along the wall. I slowed down and watched my arms' shadows
swing idly along as we walked together. But now the bridge has this low wall along
the outside of the sidewalk to keep people from falling off, I suppose, but it
looks nice, too, being all crenelated and whatever. And so as the bridge
rises, this wall rises too, not gradually like the bridge, but step-wise, so
that every few steps now, my long shadow on the building to my right is slowly
and step-wise swallowed by the swelling darkness. First the tips of my fingers
are gone. Then the wall rises again and I'm just a pair of shoulders and
a head, bobbing and swinging. Then the wall rises again and I'm
nothing but a head floating along. I was almost at the edge of the building
when I paused to watch as my shadow's severed head rolled along without me,
off the wall and over the highway and across the narrow park and into the
river. It plunged into the little waves and disappeared. I smiled and laughed
and said goodbye:

Bridge over river\
Setting sun draws\
Last rays from its quiver\
A shadow's severed head\
Rolls and rolls and rolls\
Into the river.

I had lost all sense of time, but we must have been on our seventh or eighth pose when the buttery smell of French toast that had been wafting up from the diner below the studio all class turned more acrid. We were in child's pose, I remember. The woman next to me had fallen asleep two poses ago. That tended to happen in these classes. I sniffed slightly before beginning my next inhale. Yes, something was definitely burning.

"Resolve to be still," said the instructor softly. Her assistant in the corner banged a gong and rubbed a mallet along the rim of a singing bowl.

_I'm here,_ I thought. I started to do a body scan to ground myself in the moment. There were my outstretched fingers tugging ever so gently against the thin ridges of the rented yoga mat. I was still upset that they charged extra for the mat. I suppose that's why you see people walking around with their own mats all the time. It couldn't possibly cost the studio that much to wipe them down after every class. They did wipe them down right? I let my head sink lower down. That was important, to let it sink, let gravity do the work. I exhaled and allowed gravity to lower my head to the mat. Yes, it smelled like artificial lavender and rubber. The smell of burnt cinnamon was still in the air though and growing stronger.

The gong reverberated. Where was I? Fingers. Palms. My palms were moist, but not uncomfortably so. It was warm in the room. I checked in on my wrists, forearms and elbows. I resisted the urge to wiggle anything. Sometimes I felt like I couldn't really feel my arms unless I moved them. They were there though, I assured myself. I resolved to be still. Like a spotlight on a watchtower, I moved my focus to my shoulders. My shoulders were definitely there. They were sore from yesterday's workout class.

"Relax into the pose," said the instructor. As my butt sank lower to the ground, I imagined the coils and knots of tension and anxiety ease their way out of my stomach and into the floor. Here I was.

"Remember today's mantra," said the instructor. "I am exactly where I need to be."

_I am exactly where I need to be,_ I thought. There were screams coming from downstairs; there was no longer a hint of cinnamon in the air, just foul smoke. I opened my eyes briefly. In front of me, no one had moved. I closed my eyes. I was exactly where I needed to be. I examined each of my vertebrae, gently willing them to separate farther and farther.

It was time for the next pose. Slowly, we walked our hands in and raised our seats into table top pose. We paused there and then lowered into sphinx pose. The woman next to me woke up with a start. She looked around, screamed and fled the room. She had left her mat. I hoped she would come back for it later. It was a nice mat, not a cheap rental like mine.

"I am exactly where I need to be," said the instructor. I repeated the mantra to myself. There was no gong or singing bowl this time. The assistant had gone. The room felt warmer. At the back of my mind, I started to feel something like fear take shape. It nagged at me, but I let it flow down and out of my body. The fire was not in the studio.

Soon though, it was. Thick smoke filled the air. Each deep, slow breath became harder. Someone behind me started coughing. The pale blue curtains that decorated the front wall were ablaze. There must have been a fire alarm going off, but I never heard it.

"Resolve to be still," said the instructor. Her voice had become raspy. "I am exactly where I need to be."

"I am exactly where I need to be," the class repeated together.

_Panic!_ said a voice in my head. _It's time to panic!_ But I was relaxed. I was where I needed to be. I continued my body scan. There was my lumbar. I could really feel it in this pose. It felt good. My butt was clenched. I let the muscles relax. My inner eye drifted down my legs. My left calf was on fire. One of the ceiling tiles had fallen on it, I think. My acrylic leggings were burning quickly. The pain was sharp. Class wasn't over, but it was probably time to leave. I rose slowly to table top pose and crawled out of the room.

When I woke up in a hospital room some time later, I continued my body scan where I had left off. With closed eyes, I looked at my toes. I couldn't feel them. I tried to wiggle them, but nothing wiggled. I couldn't feel anything at all. I screamed, but by now, it was too late to panic.

There was something more ominous about the doorbell in the morning.

\*\*\*

When Annie moved in, her roommates were still away for the holidays. She had a week to herself, alone in a new city and new apartment. During the day, she enjoyed the freedom and the solitude. With no sisters to tease her, she sang loudly in the shower, no longer just mouthing the words. With no nagging roommates, she let the dishes pile up. She'd get to them before Sunday.

Johnny wasn't afraid of the dark.

They screamed when they died. Death came at any hour, but there were always more screams right before dawn, as if the victims could not bear the thought of another day.

The busboy was dead. The manager had insisted that they be called servers' assistants, but the new term never stuck. The knife, however, did. Its dull black handle quivered slightly between the busboy's shoulder blades.

The realtor, Z, unlocked the door and then led us down the long, dark hallway into the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, he gestured vaguely and said, ‚ÄúYeah, take a look around.‚Äù

\*\*\*

There were no stairs in the stairwell in the apartment building where the vampires lived.  From the sidewalk, passerby might notice the stairwell‚Äôs lack of stairs, but most would dismiss it as a trick of the light, or an effect produced simply by the angle of the windows. Some people were not so easily self-deluded; they raised questions at city council meetings or tweeted about the mysterious building without any stairs. These people were hunted and drained of their blood.

When Sam Worthers, a stock broker at Lilith & Sons, arrived at work on Tuesday, he knew immediately that something was wrong. All the graphs had started going up and to the left. Up, Sam had learned, was good, but they usually also went to the right. Sam banged the side of his monitor, hoping to straighten out the bug. Undisturbed, the graphs crawled leftward.

On the living room wall hung an elegant oil painting of a pistol. In a neat

 ˝å®A poem  weightingWaiting  ¸<P
When the Christmas tree arrived in early December, all the other plants in the house
made fun of him. At night, they would gather in the living room and tease him
mercilessly.

"Hey, hey Christmas tree, know why they call you a conifer?" the hanging pothos
would begin. "Cuz you're shaped like a cone! An ugly cone!"

"Cone face! Cone face!" the other plants would chant.

"Ugly, ugly cone face!" the hanging pothos would conclude.

The plants would jeer and laugh. The Christmas tree would ooze a little sap and shed
a few more needles.

Some of the mean jokes the plants told weren't very good, but they still hurt the
poor Christmas tree's feelings, especially when the little succulents giggled along
with the rest of them. Those three had seemed so nice at first, in their cute little
painted pots. But they laughed all the same. One night, they even told their own cruel joke.

"Hey, hey Christmas tree," said the little spiky round one, "what's the inverse function
of x to the second power?"

"I don't - I don't know," stammered the Christmas tree, who wasn't very good at algebra,
especially under such circumstances.

"It's the square _root_!" squealed the flat, pale green one.

"Get it? Get it! Because he has no roots!" explained the green and white striped one.

The other plants chuckled and elbowed each other knowingly.

"He's a dead plant standing and he doesn't even know it!" cackled the snake plant.

But he did know it and they sure wouldn't let him forget it either. The base of his trunk
ached; he had been chopped nearly in half. Without his roots, he knew he wouldn't last long.
And the metal rods of the tree stand stabbed painfully into him on all sides, like some
sort of medieval torture device. But the worst pain of all was the ache in his heart
from missing his friends at the tree farm. They had held roots and danced and played games
and told kind, funny jokes that didn't hurt anyone's feelings. To think of them now,
while these bullies laughed and laughed, was more than he could take. He cried and sobbed
and wept. He sniffled and sniveled, whimpered and wailed. He shook with each sob and when
he shook, needles rained down.

The other plants were grossed out by the Christmas tree's pitiful weeping. They moved
into the far corner of the living room. Forming a circle that the Christmas tree couldn't
help but find depressingly similar to his old dance circles at the farm, the plants
gossipped into the wee hours of the morning. They did not dance.

At last, before the family dog woke, they scampered off back to their assigned places,
leaving the Christmas tree a few peaceful moments of solitude. _Just you wait,_ thought
the Christmas tree, _just you wait._

\*\*\*

A couple weeks later, the adult children arrived home for the holidays. Together, the family
decorated the Christmas tree. The balls and the bells and the candy canes and the porcelain angels
and the lights and the stuffed bears and the nutcrackers and the fluffy sheep and the miniature Taj
Mahal and the dozen or so other last minute gifts weighed heavily on the tree's weary branches.
But he endured. _I'll be so pretty,_ he thought.

But the newly arrived poinsettia made faces at him the whole time from her spot on the coffee table.

"Wait until you see my lights. We'll see who's laughing then," mouthed the Christmas tree in a rare
moment of courage.

It was time. The father pulled up a chair and fixed a star to the very top of the tree. Then the
older daughter plugged in the string lights while the mother turned off the overhead ones.
The multi-colored LED's cast a soft, calm glow throughout the room. The glittery decorations
shimmered beautifully. The Christmas tree felt a surge of pride. _This is life,_ he thought.
_This is how it's meant to be. Who needs roots anyway?_

The family stepped back to admire the tree.

"It's a little crooked, right?" said the son.

"Yeah," said the younger daughter. "At least the ornaments hide how bare it really is."

"Maybe we should have gotten that other one," said the mother.

"Well, maybe you should be watering it more!" said the father.

"And maybe I should never had said yes!" said the mother.

Saddened to have caused such distress, the Christmas tree sighed. Its branches
dropped lower and a sparkling glass pinecone fell to the floor. It shattered.

"Droopier by the minute," muttered the father. "I need some air," he said, heading to the front door.

"Go get the broom, will you?" said the mother to the son. "Oh no! Rosco, no! Bad dog. Someone get Rosco!"

Rosco, the family dog, now old and blind, had gone to investigate the noise. Both daughters lunged
to scoop him up, but it was too late. He stepped on a piece of broken glass, letting out a startled yelp.
In their haste, the daughters butted heads. Thud! Grabbing their heads, they began arguing about
who was to blame. Rosco, meanwhile, was barking impatiently and limping around the room, leaving behind
a trail of blood on the rug. The son hadn't made any movement broom-wards. In fact, he had plopped
down on the couch. "Fine, I'll get it myself," said the mother. "I'll do everything myself."

The poinsettia could hardly contain her laughter. Oh, the story she could tell that night! It would
be such a hoot! "All your fault," she mouthed at the Christmas tree. "All your fault."

\*\*\*

And so, that night, the Christmas tree had already cried his heart out before the other plants
had even arrived. He didn't think it could get any worse.

"Hey, hey Christmas tree," said the hanging pothos, "nice hat!"

"Ha!" agreed the snake plant. "What a stupid, stupid hat! A stupid hat for a stupid tree!"

It was getting worse. The senseless cruelty continued into the night. The poinsettia
regaled the crowd with the drama of the evening. The snake plant laughed the hardest.
He thought the poinsettia was pretty.

But despite it all, the Christmas tree knew he was beautiful and glittery and that his
hat wasn't stupid. He may have shed some needles that night, but no more tears. And
he bore the weight of his decorations proudly, without the slightest drooping.

And so, as Christmas neared, the plants grew tired of bullying the Christmas tree. Or maybe
they had run out of jokes. Either way, they started meeting in the kitchen instead. Their
laughter echoed down the hall, but the Christmas tree preferred being forgotten to being tormented.
One night, the snake plant slipped in to the living room to make out with the poinsettia.
They kissed and whispered to each other like he wasn't even there. As things grew more intimate,
the poinsettia glanced cautiously in his direction.

"Ignore him. He doesn't matter. He's practically dead already. Focus on me, babes," said the snake plant.

\*\*\*

The day after Christmas, the mother took down all the decorations and carried the tree to the curb.
He was more brown than green by then and weighed hardly anything. The town's waste disposal services
picked him up later that week. He had his last few conscious thoughts in the back of the truck,
surrounded by the dead and dying carcasses of his fellow trees. He imagined he was back at the farm,
dancing with his friends. He imagined them all complimenting each other's outfits, especially his
fancy star hat. He thought of a good retort for one of the pothos' jokes. He was thirsty, so very
thirsty. He died and was turned to mulch.

The next year, the mother and father decided to buy a plastic tree. It was much more practical.
The house plants, deprived of their seasonal victim, turned on the spiky succulent, the only one
of the three who had survived the year.

"Hey, hey Spikes," began the hanging pothos, "why didn't the cactus get invited to the birthday party?"

From our vantage point on the cliff, the agents were small and
foreshortened. They were looking for the sizemickerator, but we hadn't hidden
it there. They turned over rocks and dug holes aimlessly. Two of them had metal
detectors. Fools. The device wasn't made of metal, not any that can be so easily detected.
I looked at Conrad. He nodded. I nodded back. I looked at Stephanie. She nodded and I
nodded back.

We sat down on the bench stiffly. My wig itched. I worried that I had picked one with
lice. Unable to resist any longer, I scratched my head. Conrad frowned at me and pushed
the wig back into place, off my forehead. He had a gentle touch. I wondered if his
wife missed him. My brief, frantic scratch had made the itch worse. I shoved my hands into
my pockets. Oh, there was the detonator.

Stephanie cleared her throat and checked her watch. She looked uncomfortable. Was she
having second thoughts? Did she think it wouldn't work? No, it was probably just her
disguise. Hers must be itchy too. It probably wasn't a good time to ask. She nodded again.
Conrad, cool as ever, began tapping out a metronome with his Oxfords.

Ten. Would it work? Would it matter? How many extra people would die? Nine. The
idiots down on the beach, sure, but they had signed up for their jobs. They knew the
risk. Well, sort of. Eight. But what of the people out on their boats? Or on little islands
farther out? Who cares? Seven. We had already crunched the numbers. A few excess here and
there, but we would save millions more. My conscience--six--my conscience was clear. Or
as clear as it could be. I don't think I will ever atone for the last experiment. It's
past. It's past. Five. A sunk cost. And I had lost my Sara. I had paid the cost too. Four.
Did I remember a snack? It was going to be a long bus ride. If we made it out, of course.
Three. Focus. Focus. Conrad's foot hesitated.

Oh, pull it together, tough guy. I stared at him side-eyed, a look that I hoped was
equal parts exasperated and encouraging. Stephanie once told me that all my facial
expressions seemed exasperated. I hope Sara didn't think so. I hope she knew how much
I loved her. Conrad's foot finally fell. Two. He hadn't seen me looking at him. He was
intent on the beach. They'd spotted us. They were yelling. One drew his weapon. One.

I pressed the detonator firmly. It gave more resistance than I had expected. Conrad and
Stephanie must have pressed theirs too because from far off at sea, we could hear a low
rumble. It was working! A bullet whizzed past my ear. Shit! It needed to work a little bit
faster. Ducking low, Stephanie grabbed me by the arm and started to pull me into the woods.
I turned to get Conrad too, but he was already dead. It didn't affect the math, of course
it didn't, but it still hurt to see him lying there like that, knowing I would never
hear his crazy laugh again. He would never adjust my wig again, never graze my forehead.
The damn thing still itched. I yanked it off as Stephanie and I plunged into the treeline.

We ducked behind a thick trunk to catch our breath. At last, we could hear the screams
from the beach. And then, soon enough, the rumbling and grinding drowned out the screams.
It worked! It worked!

I glanced back and smiled with satisfaction at the receding waves and the beach rising
to meet the cliff. We'd bought ourselves another 40 years, at least. I grabbed a clementine
from my backpack. Stephanie and I started jogging towards the bus stop. Take that, Longfellow,

I moved from the [Enormous Bean](/beantown) to the Big Apple a little over two weeks ago.
Several people have asked me if I like it. I do, I say, but when I'm walking around, dodging mopeds,
I find myself preoccupied with fear. I know that at any moment I may be accosted by Brandon Stanton and be
forced to whip up some deep and sweet and pithy story that exactly captures the essence of my life and the essence
of what it is to be alive. This fear, more so than the mopeds, keeps me on my toes. Well, Mr. Stanton, here you go.
These are a few stories about life in the city, moving, and fleeting moments of joy. There is also one
deep one about The Machine and our relation to it. Now leave me alone.

When the woman at the burger place handed me my bag, the ticket slipped out
of her hand and flew around. She caught it and laughed. "Nice catch," I said.

\*\*\*

I had just left work and was walking to the subway when it started to rain. It was
late evening thunderstorm rain, the kind you know is about to get worse. When the
first drops fell, someone behind me screamed. I turned to see a woman scrambling to
get under the nearest awning, pulling her friend along with her. Her friend was
laughing at her. "Get the umbrella, get the umbrella," the first woman said.

Her hair looked flawless. I hope it stayed that way.

"Excuse me. Hey! You forgot your broom," said the Target cashier. I hustled back,
shaking my head. "Thanks," I said. In that single glance, a mere second of eye
contact, I felt like he knew everything I had been through that whole week to
end up at Target on Labor Day at 5pm, buying a broom and barbecue sauce and
suction cup shower shelves and Swiffer Wipes and 3 white undershirts and sesame seeds
and then almost leaving without the broom. He saw, too, everything he had just saved me from.

\*\*\*

Having helped my roommate move from 4pm to 11pm the night before, I woke up at 6:45am to
meet my other roommate to drive (in the van she had rented and driven from Boston) to a Budget
office so that I, being physically present at the office, could be added to the list of allowed
and insured drivers, so that I could legally and under insurance coverage drive the van to
New Jersey to retrieve all of my belongings, which I had left at my parents house. (Yes, we
tried to add me to the list of drivers beforehand, but I was not in Boston when my roommate
got the van. Yes, I could have rented a separate van. No, I never managed to get on the list.
Yes, I drove the van anyways. No, I didn't hit anything. It was fine. This is all besides the point.)

When we got to the Budget office, the only place to park was a parking garage, but the clearance of
the garage was not high enough for the van. It was at this point that we realized that we had driven
25 minutes through Brooklyn to a Budget Car Rental office, not a Budget Truck Rental office. I
figured that it wouldn't hurt to ask if they could help anyways, so I jumped out.

The office was inside the parking garage, around a few corners, a detail which will become important soon.
I made my way to the office. The Budget man, triaging the two-person line while a third person
finished filling out some forms, asked me why I was there. I explained the situation.

"You need Budget Truck Rental for that, my friend. This is Budget Car Rental," he said, predictably.

"There's no way you can help?" I asked hopelessly.

He shook his head gravely. He was wearing a yellow do-rag. I left, winding my way back through
the parking garage and out towards the corner to hail the circling van. On the sidewalk, a line
had formed in front of a coffee and pastry cart. Not two spots from the front was a man in a yellow
do-rag. I did a double take. It was the Budget man!

"How'd you get here so fast?" I asked, laughing.

He said, "I'm Batman. It's my bat cave. I've got secret exits."

\*\*\*

I updated my address at work and was prompted to fill out the New York State Department of
Taxation and Finance's Form IT-2104: Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate, New York State -
New York City - Yonkers. Rather than let me upload a PDF version of the form, the horrible, over-designed
payroll software that my company uses forced me to fill out the form using their horrible, over-designed
user interface. The first question on Form IT-2104 is "Are you a resident of New York City? Yes/No."
I thought that I was, but the payroll software had pre-selected "No" and wouldn't let me change it.

Maybe I should show it my moped-dodging skills. Maybe I should show it my vignettes. Or, maybe, it's
right. Maybe I haven't moved in yet.

I was sitting at a desk in the office, watching my email inbox accumulate unread messages. It was really more of a table than a desk. It had no drawers and people ate at it; it had six chairs, too. I clicked on an email, stared at it for a while, and then clicked the back button. A few days before, I had reduced my trackpad‚Äôs sensitivity as far as it could go. Each click was now laborious. I dragged my finger from corner to corner of the trackpad and the mouse creeped upwards a few pixels.

I thought about how I was feeling. I came up with ‚Äúennui.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt really sure what it meant or if I could feel it (does one feel ennui?), but it felt like the right word. I rolled it over in my head. ‚ÄúEnnui,‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúEnnn-wahhhh.‚Äù I paused, doubting my pronunciation. ‚ÄúEn-wee?‚Äù I thought. I curled my lips and mouthed it silently: ‚ÄúEn-wah.‚Äù The man sitting to the left across from me glanced in my direction. I swallowed guiltily and took a sip of water.

Some time had passed. The first page of my inbox had filled up. I looked out the window. The co-working space was on the 26th floor in a sky scraper in the middle of downtown. Beyond the table, beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, half the city stretched out before me. In the shimmering haze of the midday sun, it looked unreal. Above the distant foothills, cumulus clouds piled up and drifted towards the city. As the afternoon wore on, they grew more and more numerous and came closer and closer to the co-working space. They looked like a herd of sheep in a lazy simile.

When the spaceship thwipped into existence outside the window at 2:37, I thought at first that it was another cloud. But it was definitely a spaceship, the flying saucer kind, only slightly bigger than I had expected. No one else seemed to notice; there was some sort of popcorn bar/dried flower bouquet social event going on in the micro-kitchen. A thin red laser sliced a hole in the window, which sent the circular cut-out gliding down to the street. There was a distant crash.

Through the hole in the window, a gust of wind blew. A conical energy beam followed the gust. The man to my left across from me noticed the gust, but not the beam. He shrugged on his sweater. The beam focused on me and I floated into the spaceship like a Far Side dairy cow, only I was going in horizontally because the ship was at eye level. Like everything else that day, the beam was slow. I thought about my mouse, inching towards the back button. I wondered if they had a sensitivity setting on the beam.  I had time to grab a couple snacks that I had left out by my computer for later‚Äîa six-pack of Ritz Peanut Butter Crackers and a Brown Sugar Cinnamon Pop-Tart. I wasn‚Äôt sure how long it would take.

I had watched the Congressional hearings, so I wasn‚Äôt scared, but when I was almost at the window, I decided to scream. ‚ÄúAhh! Help! I‚Äôm being abducted!‚Äù I yelled. No one heard me. The beam, it seemed, was noise-cancelling. I was impressed.

I landed in what appeared to be the bridge. There were various controls and knobs and wheels and such all over. A folding table had been set up with two chairs, apparently for my interrogation or brainwashing or probe. There were no straps on the chairs or table, so I was more confident that I wouldn‚Äôt be hurt. ‚ÄúUnless their mind control renders restraints unnecessary‚Ä¶‚Äù I thought. A melon-sized space snail floated in a yellow tank on top of a pedestal to my right. Standing in front of me was an alien, about four feet tall, green, big eyes, classic pointy chin, two probe-y fingers on each hand, cute shorts and a ray gun clipped casually to its belt. It looked at me blankly, as if it hadn‚Äôt done this before and was surprised that the whole thing had worked so far.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said. I hate silence.

It stared.

‚Äú¬øIngl√©s?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúSi, claro. Hablamos todos los idiomas del universo.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, I don‚Äôt speak Spanish.‚Äù

‚ÄúEnglish is fine,‚Äù it said.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúI have a one-on-one with my manager at three.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem. We have just a few questions about Agile Methodology,‚Äù it said, gesturing to the chairs. We sat.

‚ÄúOkay, shoot,‚Äù I said.

Before I could blink, the alien drew its ray gun and aimed it at my chest. I shouted in protest and explained that it was a figure of speech, an idiom. The alien re-clipped the gun in its belt and jotted down some notes into a small notebook. The way it held the pen with its two alien fingers and no thumb made me uncomfortable. I ran my thumb over the Ritz crackers package in my pocket, thankful for my thumbs and my snacks.

As promised, it asked me some questions about Agile and Scrum. I explained all about stand-ups and ‚Äúno blockers‚Äù and Jira tickets and how we sprint for two weeks and then sprint again and again and moving quickly to respond to feedback and delivering minimally viable products and deploying once a week and half planning and quarter planning and sprint planning and grooming the backlog and retro and how we assign numbers to units of work but make sure to avoid assigning the bad numbers like four, six or seven. Throughout our conversation, it took notes and asked follow-up questions. At times, it made low, guttural noises in the direction of the space snail. I think the space snail was in charge. I think it was laughing at me.

At some point, I ate my snacks. I offered the alien and the snail each a Ritz. The snail refused. The alien stuck the cracker in its ear. I didn‚Äôt share my Pop-Tart. My mouth turned dry and I wished I had also grabbed my water bottle. I wanted to ask for a drink, but I wasn‚Äôt sure if they would have filtered water on the space ship.

At last, the alien thanked me for my time and said to hold still while they beamed me back.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you erase my memory first?‚Äù

The alien turned to the snail and groaned.

‚ÄúPlease?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou could do the whole day. The whole week! The year! I don‚Äôt mind. I really don‚Äôt.‚Äù

But, alas, I was already trapped in the energy beam, floating back to my table, all my memory mercilessly intact. The beam back was a lot faster. I slammed into my chair and it slid backwards several inches with a squeak. The man to my left across from me looked over with a flicker of annoyance. Never mind the flying saucer behind him. Never mind the perfectly circular hole in the window through which the wind still gusted.

It was 3:04. I was late! In a rush, I used keyboard shortcuts to navigate to my 1-1 meeting. I had no time for my mouse.

‚ÄúHi, sorry I‚Äôm late, alien abduction,‚Äù I explained.

My manager nodded frame by frame. The connection was bad. I wondered if he had heard me. He began: ‚ÄúSo, we need to talk. Your story point metrics have been down for the last three sprints. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

There once was a young woman named Wynne who woke up to find a bug bite on her shin. It itched, so she scratched. And she scratched and she scratched and she scratched until it bled. She grabbed a tissue and wiped up the blood, but then she went on scratching as hard as she could. Every so often, when the blood dripping down her leg threatened to drip onto the floor, she paused to wipe it some more.

As she scratched, the itch grew itchier and the area that itched grew too. Little by little and inch by inch, she scratched a little bit higher and scratched a little bit lower. Before long, Wynne was scratching from the cap of her knee to the tips of her toes. Blood was flowing all over; her tissue was soaked. She stood up to get another, but the itch took right over. She sat back down and kept at her scratching.

She scratched and she scratched and she scratched until she hit bone. With no skin left on her shin, surely the bug bite was gone, but the itch kept on at its itching. And so Wynne kept on at her scratching.

The itch spread to the back of her leg, so she scratched the back of her calf. When she tore into her muscle, it hurt a bit. But the pain was a relief from the itch, so she kept on at it. When she reached her fibula, there was a horrible screech, like nails on a chalkboard made out of fibula. The itch then grew worse where it had begun, so she returned to scratching her tibia. She scratched this bone with such vigor, that, one by one, her fingernails snapped off.

Wynne had nothing left with which to scratch, but, of course, the itch was only getting worse. With one bony leg, she hobbled to the key hook by the door. While she hobbled, she nearly took a tumble in the pile of flesh and gore. She picked up her keys and held them in her fist like claws.

The itch was still itching, so she sat down and continued her scratching. The sharp metal teeth of the keys provided, at first, some relief, but then the itch began itching beyond all belief. Now her right leg was itchy. And now her back. And then one arm and then the other. And now it seemed like her every cell was itchy. And now, she realized with a start, the itch was the itchiest right in her heart. So she scratched and she scratched and she scratched until she was nothing. At last, the itch stopped.

I had a philosophy teacher in high school teach us about Aristotle‚Äôs Three Unities: of Time, Place and Action. I do not know, nor really wish to know, whether Aristotle really came up with these Unities or if they were instead this teacher‚Äôs own theory. In learning about the Unities, we were never provided with a primary source (unless you consider Mr. Poglinco to be the originator of the theory, in which case his scrawled notes on the blackboard were primary). In fact, we never read any Aristotle in the whole course. We never got any secondary sources discussing the Unities either, although we did read a fair number of academic papers analyzing whatever book or play we were reading. Any one of these could have focused on or at least mentioned offhandedly Aristotle‚Äôs Three Unities, provided, of course, that it was Aristotle who came up with the Unities and not Mr. Poglinco.

I could, obviously, open a new tab and immediately verify what I learned in high school about Aristotle‚Äôs Three Unities. But it‚Äôs been seven years since I took Philosophy and Literature with Mr. Poglinco. I‚Äôve spent seven years thinking about the Unities. They‚Äôve informed the way that I read and watch TV and movies. Some of the stories I‚Äôve written on this blog make a conscious effort to follow them. I‚Äôve told other people about them. (No one, by the way, has ever said, ‚ÄúOh yeah, I remember learning about that too,‚Äù or ‚ÄúAh, yes, Aristotle‚Äôs Three Unities. I was just reading about them.‚Äù) What would it mean for my life, these past seven years, if Mr. Poglinco had lied to us? Probably nothing. The Three Unities, as we learned them, constitute, I think, a pretty good framework for analyzing a story. Whether it was Aristotle or my pony-tailed English teacher or some third party who deceived him (Mr. P) or whom Mr. P creatively recast as Aristotle is really beside the point. The theory should stand on it‚Äôs own.

But consider: why do I now agonize over whether or not to open a new tab and search the whole of the Internet for information about Aristotle‚Äôs Three Unities? There‚Äôs probably a Wikipedia page on it and probably a lengthy entry in Stanford‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Philosophy. (Yet, why, in seven years, have I never seen or heard a single reference to the theory?) But if I did seek out these sources, what would it say about me? About my ability to trust people, to trust myself and to trust my own ability to tell if English teachers are just making stuff up? What would it say about the American education system if I felt compelled to fact check everything my teachers told me? If I can‚Äôt trust Mr. P, then who can I trust? Who else lied to me?

By now, you might be curious about what Aristotle‚Äôs Three Unities are. I doubt you have heard of them before unless I told you or you also had Mr. Poglinco for Philosophy and Literature. As I‚Äôve said, I‚Äôve never encountered any reference to the theory‚Äôs existence outside of that second floor classroom. If you have heard of them from some other source, I don‚Äôt necessarily want you to write to me excitedly about how Mr. Poglinco was an honest man and that Aristotle did think those things about plays and that the American public education system isn‚Äôt entirely worthless. I know these things or at least I think I do. No matter what, I don‚Äôt want to need you to confirm them in order to know them.

But it‚Äôs more likely that you‚Äôve never heard of Aristotle‚Äôs Three Unities. And maybe you reflexively opened a new tab and googled the term as soon as you read the first sentence. Maybe you shouted across the room at your digital spyware, ‚ÄúAlexa! What‚Äôs the Aristotle Three Unities?‚Äù Maybe it actually understood you and now you know more about it than I do (or rather about about it, as in whether the theory exists, not necessarily its contents). If you have done this, I am somewhat inclined to think somewhat less of you. Can you not resist your curiosity? Must you peek? Moreover, don‚Äôt you trust me? Trust me, I will tell you what Aristotle‚Äôs Three Unities are (at least according to Mr. Poglinco (and my (fallible) memory)).

To wit, they are: Unity of Place, meaning that the events of the story occur in a single location; Unity of Time, meaning that the events in the story progress continuously in time without jumps forward or flashbacks; and Unity of Action, with Action being used here in the theatrical sense as in the protagonist‚Äôs desire and the Unity thereof meaning that the protagonist wants one and only one thing throughout the story, which desire drives the plot, and that the story has no significant subplots.* These Three Unities were viewed by Aristotle as essential elements of any good play.* For example, Aristotle would vomit over the subplots, flashbacks, temporal trickery and scene changes of any Christopher Nolan movie.*

Again, I don‚Äôt really want you to reach out to tell me, ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs exactly what it says online,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúHuh, you‚Äôre kind of close, but no one has ever used ‚ÄòAction‚Äô in that way ever before,‚Äù or whatever. I am actively not seeking confirmation of my knowledge. I‚Äôm just thinking out loud into the infinite void of the Internet.

Anyway‚Ä¶

### Discussion Questions for Your Reading Group

- What is ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù? For instance, does the author ‚Äúknow‚Äù what Aristotle‚Äôs Three Unities are? Does anyone?
- Is the Internet good or bad? For instance, is it bad because it has created in the author a crushing doubt of everything he ever learned outside of it and also a ravenous desire to look everything up? Or is it essentially good or at least neutral and the author an absolute fool for not using it in this particular instance?
- To what extent does this blog post follow each of Aristotle‚Äôs Three Unities?

Take the bomb scene from the 1960s Batman movie and put it on a double-decker NJ Transit train. ([Please watch it here first](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Nri3o0KFg-8).) As the fuse shortens, Batman races with the bomb up the length of the train. At each car, he must decide between the upper level and lower level in a series of increasingly thorny ethical dilemmas. Up to the level with 50 kids on a school field trip or down to the level with two newlyweds? 6 ex-convicts or 12 stock brokers? 10 pregnant women or 5 parents each with their newborn baby? Robin or Catwoman? And so on.

Eventually, when the fuse is almost out and the harrowing music is reaching a crescendo, Batman reaches the first car (he‚Äôs been running forward through the train). Up the stairs are the man who murdered his parents and the Pope. Below are the Joker, the Riddler, Penguin and the Dalai Lama. He hesitates. A fierce, foul wind blows from the gap between the cars, causing Batman to stumble. He realizes there‚Äôs a gap between the cars and tosses the bomb out into the toxic swamp of the Meadowlands. Incidentally, a toxic swamp monster is on its way through the toxic swamp to terrorize Gotham at that very moment. It is killed by the bomb. Having defeated the toxic swamp monster and conquered utilitarianism, Batman rushes up the stairs, forgives his parents‚Äô killer and french kisses the Pope, much to the envy of the Dalai Lama.

In September, my roommates and I moved into a new apartment that has a Google Nest thermostat. At first, we manually set the temperature to what seemed reasonable. If we got too cold or too hot, we walked to the hallway and adjusted it. It was terribly inconvenient. After a couple of weeks living like some sort of poor, I finally got around to downloading the app.

I‚Äôve forgotten the details, but the setup process sucked. There‚Äôs a Nest app and a Google Home app and apparently Google is planning on sunsetting the Nest app, but hasn‚Äôt moved all the features over, so you really need the Nest app, but you can‚Äôt create a ‚ÄúHome‚Äù without the Home app. Oh, and now Google will know what temperature your home is, please check this box to agree to the privacy policy, thank you. (‚ÄúBack in my day, thermostats didn‚Äôt have privacy policies. *I* was the thermostat. When it got too cold, your great-grandfather would send me out to the wood shed to get another log to put on the fire and when it got too hot, I had to crank the hand-cranked fan and I had to walk six miles to school with forty pounds of textbooks in my bag, uphill both ways bla bla bla‚Ä¶‚Äù)

I learned during the set up process that our Nest was a smart thermostat. It had a motion detector, so it would learn when we were home or away, and adjust the temperature accordingly. It would also learn what temperatures we preferred during different parts of the day.

###### ![Squidward, shocked by the all-chrome future, cowers on the floor, crying "futuuuuure](assets/future.jpg)

I woke up at 3am that first night drenched in sweat. Clearly, the thermostat hadn‚Äôt learned anything. And how could it? *Okay*, I thought, beginning to panic, *I‚Äôll just manually override the temperature now and then it‚Äôll learn to keep it cooler at night. And now I can even stay in bed to adjust it with the app. How nice is that? Okay, back to sleep. The AC will kick on soon. But, wait. How long will it take to learn that it‚Äôs too hot. Will I have to override it at 3am for a week? A month? What if it over-corrects and makes it too cold? I guess I just have to teach it by providing feedback. But why am I teaching a thermostat?! And the entire time that I‚Äôm teaching it, it will be the wrong temperature and I won‚Äôt be able to sleep or the electric bill will skyrocket. And what if it learns bad habits from my roommates? Oh, god, what if it thinks we‚Äôre not home? I came in the back door tonight, so I haven‚Äôt passed the motion sensor since this morning. And when we work from home, we could go hours and hours without ever passing it. Will we have to take turns walking past the thermostat to keep the AC on? How does it work? How does it learn? What am I doing, sweating here trying to figure out how to train a thermostat?! I‚Äôm the one with the body! I‚Äôm the one who can learn what temperature I like. I‚Äôm the one who can negotiate with my roommates. I‚Äôm the smart one. Me!*

I turned off all the stupid learning features.

Now it‚Äôs just a thermostat that I can control with an app. This is kind of nice.

_Note: for maximum enjoyment, please first [read the mystery, available here](/hooked-mystery)_

‚ÄúIt was a dark, rainy August night in the small, close-knit beach town in New Jersey. The mayor arrived home late, exhausted after a long day laboring over her proposal for a new community crypto-mining farm in the soon-to-be-demolished library‚Äôs plot. Shaking off the rain from her bright pink umbrella with one hand, she checked the mailbox with the other. She rifled through the contents, tossing the spam, ads and credit card offers into the nearby bushes. She paused, however, at a small green envelope with no postage, addressed simply to ‚ÄúMayor‚Äù. Curious, she stepped inside, hung her umbrella on the hook, and tore open the envelope. 'DOCKS. 2AM TONIGHT. TELL NO ONE,' it read. It was unsigned and the all-caps handwriting was deliberately plain, but the mayor knew immediately that it was the librarian. Who else owned stationery these days?

‚ÄúThis past year, the mayor had made her stance on public libraries very clear and there was no shortage of ill will between her and the librarian. To an outside observer, the letter might seem very much like a threat, or at the very least, a trap. Such an observer would probably advise the mayor to toss the letter into the bushes with the rest of the spam. But, those involved in the town‚Äôs government, the librarian included, knew that the mayor was very receptive to persuasion. No matter how strongly she felt about public libraries, she cared more deeply for strong, logical, recurring arguments. In the foyer, the mayor smiled to herself. Perhaps she could come around to the librarian after all. She microwaved her leftover foie gras, ate it, and then settled in to bed for a short nap, setting her alarm for 1:30 a.m., eager to learn what profits the night might bring.

---

‚ÄúThe mayor‚Äôs husband, meanwhile, was locking up the local history museum where he worked as director. As his relationship with his wife grew stormier and stormier, he had taken to working later and later; it was now well after 11:00 p.m. He glanced around furtively into the gloomy night and subconsciously pulled his briefcase closer to his body. He popped open his black umbrella and, almost running, hurried to the waterfront. In his briefcase were several of the museum‚Äôs most priceless artifacts‚Äîtwo matching pirate outfits in mint condition, believed to have been worn by Captain William Kidd‚Äôs first and second mates; several sheathed daggers; a gold chain; three bejeweled bangles; and a brass pirate hook. Even though he was the director, he was certainly not authorized to take these items and had had to carefully disable the alarm system without leaving a trace of his actions. This thrilling heist had left his heart pounding, but he was even more excited by what he knew awaited him at the docks: a romantic, role-playing tryst with his lover, the goldfish fisherman.

‚ÄúThey had met in June when the fisherman stopped by the museum. For the last few years, the fisherman had been travelling up and down the coast, buoyed by his parent‚Äôs dwindling trust fund and his sturdy boat, docking at random in small towns for a few days or weeks, catching not one goldfish the whole time. At the museum, the pirate hook had caught his eye and he asked the handsome director a few questions about it. The questions led to a drink, which led to dinner, which led to a long, steamy night on the boat, which led to an ongoing, very secret affair with deeper and deeper feelings felt by both sides, an affair which led, at last, to the handsome and respectable museum director rushing to the docks with stolen pirate relics in tow. They had experimented with Halloween costumes before, but the allure of authenticity had eaten at them all summer. At last, they were going to have some real fun.

---

‚ÄúTry as she might, the mayor couldn‚Äôt fall asleep. Maybe it was the rain. Maybe it was the promise of a fresh source of income. Either way, she sprung out of bed before her alarm and stole quietly downstairs, not wanting to wake her husband, who she assumed must be asleep on the couch by now. (It had been a rare rough patch in their marriage, but if he wouldn‚Äôt do his dishes, he didn‚Äôt deserve to share a bed with her.) She pulled on her boots and raincoat, and slipped into the night. She left her umbrella on the hook, having been mayor long enough to learn to leave bright pink items at home during secret rendezvouses. She arrived at the docks 30 minutes early and paced back and forth, deep in thought. If the librarian paid up, she would need some other building for her crypto operations. Maybe the hotel. Surely she could sneak some impossible-to-meet updates to the building code in the next spending bill to force the hotel to close. The gentle, rhythmic thunk of the boats against the dock in time with the waves helped the mayor think. But soon, she became aware of one boat that was rocking out of time with the others. Its rocking was considerably less gentle. It was a large fishing boat, equipped with a spacious cabin. Examining it now more closely, the mayor noticed a faint flicker of candlelight coming from the porthole. Squinting, she peered in. Inside were two men dressed as pirates engaged in passionate relations. It was her husband! The mayor screamed.

‚ÄúUnable to see out the window into the dark, the two men resolved to send out the mayor‚Äôs husband to investigate the commotion. In haste, he pulled up his striped pirate pants and hurried onto the dock. As he leapt from the boat, the corner of one of the night‚Äôs Trojan condom wrappers became unstuck from his shirt and fluttered to the dock, where it became stuck again. Once on the dock, he quickly realized that the scream had come from his wife, who, seeing him emerge in his pirate garb, immediately began to yell at him. Thus ensued a terrible argument about dishes and responsibility and love and trying new things in the bedroom and the museum director‚Äôs reputation, to say nothing of the mayor‚Äôs own, and some frankly horrible and bigoted notions about sexuality expressed by the mayor. The husband, disgusted with his wife, confessed meanly that he didn‚Äôt love her and never had. For this, she slapped him. He returned the slap, forgetting (or perhaps not forgetting) that he was still wearing the authentic brass pirate hook. She attempted to dodge the blow, but instead took the hook straight to the eye. Perhaps he pushed it in further on purpose or perhaps he had tried in vain to pull it out, but the deed was done. He had killed his wife.

‚ÄúHe anxiously unfastened the hook, rushed back on to the boat, gathered up his things, urged the fisherman to say nothing, promising him that they would flee for the Caribbean the following evening, that their love would be eternal, that nothing else mattered as long as they had each other. Fighting the wind with his umbrella, he ran home.

---

‚ÄúMinutes later, the librarian appeared at the docks, ready to bribe the mayor to save the library. Her hands were tucked in to her raincoat, protecting the stack of cash she had just withdrawn. When she saw the body, her hands flew up to her mouth involuntarily. As she did this, her ATM receipt fell out of her pocket and was blown over to the body. She screamed. She screamed the way only a frightened librarian, long used to silence, can scream. The seagulls sleeping nearby were woken by the din and flapped away. Before thinking about the compromising position she was in‚Äîalone at night with the body of her political enemy whom she had summoned to the docks to illegally bribe‚Äîshe called the police.

‚ÄúAnd that, I deduce, is what happened last night,‚Äù concluded the good detective Jaz Sinterton. The listening police officers applauded in amazement. That night, the police apprehended the mayor‚Äôs husband on his way to the docks. He was dragging behind him a huge suitcase stuffed with clothes, stolen pirate paraphernalia and a fake passport. Upon his arrest, he immediately confessed. The goldfish fisherman, meanwhile, waited an extra hour for his lover to arrive, but finally, decided to return to the seas, heartbroken and alone.

---

The close-knit community was, of course, shaken to its core. An emergency election for mayor was held, pitting the librarian, now respected for having what it takes to play local politics, against a reclusive and eccentric crypto-coin executive, who had just moved to town a year prior. The executive won narrowly. The library was gutted and replaced by a server farm, partly out of respect for the deceased mayor‚Äôs wishes, partly out of greed for the alleged tax revenue it would bring.

A month later, after the sentencing hearing, the town‚Äôs sheriff stopped Sinterton on the courthouse steps. ‚ÄúI have to know. How do you do it?‚Äù he asked with a bemused smile.

‚ÄúThe secret,‚Äù said Sinterton with a wink, ‚Äúis Ray Worth‚Äôs pistachio ice cream, with a generous heap of chocolate fudge on top.‚Äù

And that is just what the good detective treated himself to after having closed another case and seeing justice served once again. The ice cream also helped drown out the unending pain now inflicted by his ex-wife, who had moved in next door to live with his neighbor, the new mayor, who, it turned out, was the father of the newborn baby, Sinterton‚Äôs daily reminder of his wife‚Äôs infidelity. *I should really get a hook of my own,* thought the detective.

###### ![Liam Neeson on an important phone call](assets/liam-neeson.png)

The fourth installment of the beloved franchise starring America‚Äôs sweetheart Liam Neeson opened this past Wednesday to empty theaters. Current box office sales total to $0. This normally disappointing figure is, however, the point. Director Pierre Morel, returning to the series after his dramatic (and controversial) refusal to participate in the first two sequels, has created the unwatchable _Taken 4: Your Turn_ as a bold new experiment in cinematography. The movie‚Äôs conceit is that this time, you, the audience member, have been kidnapped and your father, played by Neeson, is coming to rescue you.

Over the film‚Äôs 4 hour and 17 minute runtime, the second-person narrative commits fully to this premise. ‚ÄúWe took the thrilling, immersive experience that movie-goers grew to expect from the _Taken_ franchise to its logical conclusion,‚Äù explained Morel. Rather than watch the movie, viewers are invited to blindfold themselves, crawl under their beds, and wait patiently for Liam Neeson to rescue them. He allegedly arrives at the 3hr 58min mark, at which point viewers are encouraged to emerge from underneath their bed and fall gratefully into his arms. Neeson will be drenched in sweat (his own) and blood (your kidnappers‚Äô). If Neeson is unavailable, your sweaty father and/or any hunky, blood-stained Irishman will do, says the studio.

100 lucky purchasers of the Blu-Ray edition will be selected for the _Taken 4: Your Turn_ Complete Experience‚Ñ¢, in which they will be kidnapped by sex traffickers and rescued by Liam Neeson himself, or a stunt double. For maximum cinematic effect, the pet dogs of the winners will be killed.

Reached for comment, voice actor Quentin Tarantino of _The Coriolis Effect_ (1994) fame, said, ‚ÄúWhat Morel is doing here is taking cinema in an entirely new direction. That he was able to top his work on the original _Taken_ and take it to a whole new level‚Äîthe trilogy, by the way, being already some of the most innovative and expressive thrillers of all time‚Äîthat just really speaks to his vision as a director, as an artist. He‚Äôs a visionary. Absolutely remarkable.‚Äù

Despite no one having watched it, or even being capable of watching it if they wanted to, the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes are in: 96% fresh from critics, 15% flop from the audience, proving once again, that everyone on the internet is lying.

## Introduction

*Hook:* It had been driven through her head, in one eye and out the other.

*Background:* A small, close-knit beach town in New Jersey; an unseasonably cold, rainy August night; foreboding winds; flickering streetlamps; the victim the town‚Äôs beloved (though also feared) mayor; etc.

*Thesis:* After a methodical analysis of the crime scene, a thorough interrogation of the suspects, and a masterly work of deductive reasoning, the good detective Jaz Sinterton will solve the case.

## Body

(It was found sprawled out on a dock in the harbor at 2am. The rain was only just beginning to wash away the blood.)

### Supporting Paragraph #1

*Topic sentence:* When the good detective Jaz Sinterton arrived at the scene of the crime minutes later (he was a light sleeper), he observed three key pieces of evidence that will help him solve the case.

*Supporting detail #1:* The murder weapon was an authentic brass pirate hook, curiously similar to the one Sinterton had seen last week at the local history museum.

*Supporting detail #2:* A small piece of light blue foil was wedged in between two planks of the dock. Despite the dark, the detective could discern a capital ‚ÄúT‚Äù in a white font on the foil.

*Supporting detail #3:* Plastered by the rain to the victim‚Äôs left shoe was a receipt. Lifting it with his tweezers, Sinterton observed that, although the ink had run, obscuring the recipient‚Äôs name, it was an ATM receipt for the cash withdrawal of $5,000 from the local bank.

*Summary/transition:* With these three key pieces of evidence in the form of a murder weapon, a piece of trash and an ATM receipt, the good detective Jaz Sinterton was well on his way to solving the case, now needing only to interrogate the suspects and apply a masterly work of deductive reasoning. He will surely bring the culprit to justice.

### Supporting Paragraph #2

*Topic sentence:* Having gathered crucial clues at the crime scene, the good detective Jaz Sinterton will now interrogate the three suspects to learn more about the nature of the crime.

*Supporting detail #1:* The first suspect is the librarian, who found the body, who reported it immediately, who has a mysterious rectangular lump in the pocket of her raincoat, and who claims to have been on her usual evening stroll to the waterfront (in the rain? at 2am?) when she stumbled upon the dead mayor.

*Supporting detail #2:* The next suspect interviewed by the detective is the fisherman, who was sporting striped blue pajama pants under his oilskin, who claims to have been sound asleep in the cabin of his boat, which is docked right next to the body, until he was awakened by the police sirens, and who said, defensively, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a goldfish fisherman. The hooks I use are much smaller. They would hardly make it through one eye.‚Äù

*Supporting detail #3:* The third suspect, reached at home at 3:40am, is the victim‚Äôs husband who works as the local history museum‚Äôs director, who was also wearing striped blue pajama pants, whose umbrella dripped from the coat hook beside the door throughout the interview, who claimed to have been home all night, who was unaware of his wife‚Äôs departure (he‚Äôs been sleeping on the couch (a rare rough patch in their marriage)), and who cried convincingly and heart-wrenchingly upon the news of his wife‚Äôs demise (though not heart-wrenchingly enough to wrench the heart of the stoic detective).

*Summary/transition:* Jaz Sinterton‚Äôs interrogation of the three suspects revealed more clues, suspicious stories, and weak alibis. It will take a masterly work of deductive reasoning to synthesize the previously collected physical evidence with the character and testimony of the suspects into an air-tight explanation of the murder.

### Supporting Paragraph #3

*Topic sentence:* Before he cracks the case, the good detective Jaz Sinterton will need to think, and while he thinks, the good reader will learn three humanizing details about the otherwise surly and grizzly detective, details which may or may not be germane to the case.

*Supporting detail #1:* Sinterton thinks best over a large cup of pistachio ice cream with hot fudge drizzle, which is why his old friend Ray Worth has opened up the local ice cream parlor early this morning, just for the detective.

*Supporting detail #2:* While devouring his ice cream alone in the booth by the window (Ray knows by now when to give him some space), the detective is shocked by the sight of his ex-wife walking into the bank across the street. She‚Äôs back in town! She‚Äôs pregnant! (Could it be his?)

*Supporting detail #3:* Distracted by this sighting (and the flurry of emotions it brought) and momentarily stumped by the case at hand, Jaz walks to the library to clear his head with a good book. He‚Äôs an avid reader and a vocal supporter of public libraries (and has recently been devastated to hear that the town council might defund theirs).

*Summary/transition:* In giving the good detective Jaz Sinterton some time to exercise his powers of masterly deduction, we have learned intriguing details about his personal life, and, perhaps, a clue or two about the case.

## Conclusion

*Re-statement of thesis:* Detective Sinterton will use the physical evidence he collected at the scene of the crime, his observations while interrogating the three suspects, and his pistachio ice cream-fueled deductive reasoning to solve the brutal murder of the close-knit town‚Äôs beloved (though also feared) mayor.

*Summary of evidence:* Specifically, the detective will piece together the story told by the authentic brass pirate hook which had been driven through the mayor‚Äôs eyes, the piece of foil stuck in the dock, the soggy ATM receipt, the dripping umbrella, the matching striped pajama pants, the mysterious bulge in the librarian‚Äôs pocket, the goldfish fisherman, the night owl librarian, the museum director/husband sleeping on the couch, the husband‚Äôs heart-wrenching tears, the detective‚Äôs pregnant ex-wife, the public library‚Äôs precarious fate, and Ray Worth‚Äôs unfathomably delicious ice cream.

*Connection to larger themes:* When Sinterton reveals the true nature of this deadly crime, it will surely shock this previously peaceful community to its very core.

*Call to action:* Write to me at unterkoefler [at] duck [dot] com if you think you‚Äôve solved the murder before the good detective Jaz Sinterton. His solution will be posted in three weeks' time.

_Note: three weeks have elapsed. The solution is [now avaible here](/hooked-solution)_
 ˝â∆lA murder mystery in the form of a five paragraph essay  hooked-mysteryjHooked: A Five Paragraph Essay Outline Murder Mystery  ¸+
Pete was an unhappy mushroom. He hadn‚Äôt always been unhappy; as a young spore, he had danced and frolicked and laughed. His good nature and whimsy had allowed him to develop a wide circle of close friends, but now he was old, lonely and unhappy. His former friends had found jobs elsewhere or fallen in love, and, in ones and twos, had gradually moved out of Pete‚Äôs neck of the woods. Fungus-wise, Pete had the whole pine grove pretty much to himself, save for some orange jelly fungus growing in the old dead log to Pete‚Äôs left, but the orange jelly fungus kept to itself and, besides, Pete couldn‚Äôt speak a word of Italian.

And so, day after day, Pete stood in his spot in the grove in a gloomy and unhappy silence. But his spot was shady, the air moist and the soil rich in nitrogen, and so, in his unhappy state, Pete told himself that he liked being alone, that he didn‚Äôt miss his friends, that he didn‚Äôt long to be young again, that he had his shade and moist air and nitrogen-rich soil and his *1,000 Extra Hard Sudoku Puzzles Edited by Will Shortz* and what else could a sad old mushroom like him ask for?

But then one day, Pete finished the thousandth extra hard sudoku puzzle. He closed the book. Instead of the calm satisfaction he had expected from this feat, Pete was overcome by a gnawing emptiness. Pete looked about him at the tall, indifferent pines, at the mean, thorny brambles, at the cold, dumb rocks, at the old, rotting log, at the patches of dirt abandoned by all his friends. There was Sue‚Äôs patch and there was Larry‚Äôs patch. And Sebastian‚Äôs. And Madison‚Äôs (Oh! If only he had had the courage to ask Madison to the dance. If only!). And the twins‚Äô, Fred and Ted. And Molly‚Äôs and Sam‚Äôs and the other Sue‚Äôs and Archie‚Äôs and‚Ä¶ A tear rolled slowly down his face. ‚ÄúWoe!‚Äù he cried aloud. ‚ÄúAll the digits, in all the rows and all the columns and all the boxes, in all the puzzles and yet, I still feel‚Ä¶ hollow.‚Äù

‚ÄúMa vicino, tutti i giochi numerici del mondo non possono riempire il vuoto di un vecchio tronco in decomposizione. Per questo √® necessaria l'amicizia o la riproduzione asessuata,‚Äù said the jelly fungus.

‚ÄúNein sprechen Deutsche,‚Äù Pete replied unhelpfully.

The jelly fungus shrugged and went back to its knitting. Pete cried and cried and cried. His vacuoles dried up and his cap wrinkled. Exhausted, he fell asleep.

\*\*\*

 The next morning, Pete awoke to the sound of scuttling. The source of this scuttling sound was a large citrus long-horned beetle, scuttling from underneath the brambles, making its way directly to Pete. The beetle wore a tall, pointy, floppy gray hat. Clenched in its mandible was an elegant pipe. Stopping just short of Pete, it made a slight bow, took a puff of the pipe, and then, in a posh British accent, said, ‚ÄúHello, you must be Pete. I‚Äôm Will.‚Äù

‚ÄúShortz?‚Äù asked Pete groggily.

‚ÄúNo, Long,‚Äù answered Will Long.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù said Pete.

‚ÄúMy name is Will Long,‚Äù said the beetle. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a wizard and I‚Äôve been sent to cast a spell on you.‚Äô‚Äù At the word ‚Äúwizard,‚Äù he wiggled his pipe meaningfully.

‚ÄúSent by whom?‚Äù asked Pete, now more awake, but not yet awake enough to be scared.

‚ÄúNever you mind all that, chap. Are you or are you not Pete the Mushroom of the Pine Grove and do you or do you not wish to be young again?‚Äù said Will.

‚ÄúWell, yes, but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo buts!‚Äù interrupted the wizard. He grabbed a nearby twig and, wielding it like a staff, twirled it potently. ‚ÄúThis won‚Äôt hurt a bit.‚Äù

With a few more twirls of the twig, another puff of the pipe and a brief incantation in Ancient Greek, Will Long, wizarding beetle, shrank and spun Pete the Mushroom into a tiny spore. In a final flourish, Will summoned forth a powerful northern wind. He scuttled away.

\*\*\*

The wind scooped Pete up and carried him out of the pine grove, across the stream, out of the forest and up and away into the sky. There Pete tumbled and rolled and floated and soared, for several days, lifted by drafts and thermals and blown about by the breeze. At first, Pete was terrified and homesick, not to mention airsick. Pete was angry with himself for letting a wizard get the best of him, catching him off guard so early in the morning like that. He was angry with whomever had sent for the wizard (probably that good-for-nothing, moldy jelly fungus!). Of course, he was also angry with the wizard for cursing him out of his shady grove with its moist air and nitrogen-rich soil.

But then a warm breeze spun Pete into a somersault. Unexpectedly, he laughed. He remembered that he was young again and that he could be happy again. He grinned and launched into a cartwheel. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm frolicking!‚Äù Pete shouted to the wide sky.

Soon, a rain came and Pete fell back to the earth. He landed in a lovely spot beside a creek. It was far, far away from home, but it already had a bustling community of mushrooms. *New friends!* thought Pete excitedly. But, alas, they were chanterelles and spoke only French. Try as he might, Pete couldn‚Äôt manage more than a ‚ÄúGem apple Pete.‚Äù So, despite the company, he couldn‚Äôt make any friends. Pete grew lonely, unhappy and old, all over again. He wished desperately for a wizard, but none came.

The End.

**************Moral:**************

You can trick an old mushroom into a new one, but you can‚Äôt teach an old mushroom new tricks. And don‚Äôt even bother trying to mushroom a new teach into an old trick.

##### ![a dead houseplant](assets/dead-plant.jpg)

As founder and chief executive of My Living Room Decor, I have a deeply
personal stake in ensuring an ambiance of natural bounty, fresh air,
and homeliness in my living room. It is thus with profound
regret that I must announce the necessary re-organization and
re-focusing of my houseplant. Specifically, we are asking 46%
of the leaves on the _Epipremnum aureum_ team to seek
opportunities elsewhere, effective immediately. A generous severance package and a
referral letter to the compost bucket is available to all those affected.

At this time, I would like to assuage any doubts raised
by investors and stakeholders regarding the long-term viability and profitability
of my houseplant. Its brown leaves and generally withered appearance are
not indicative of its demise. It is not dying! These
factors are merely a reflection of broad macroeconomic forces and hardships beyond
our control. The difficult, though needed, leaf-force
adjustment will give the plant the agility that will prove crucial to
our success as these trends play out.

Again, I would
like to take personal responsibility for this decision, while at the
same time, absolving myself of any direct blame by appealing to
the current and anticipated future state of the economy. No,
I have not watered my houseplant in six weeks. No, I
did not buy any ‚Äúplant food‚Äù for it. No,
I do not regularly open the curtains in the living room.
No, I do not shield my houseplant from cold drafts despite
its specific request that I do so. But these facts (viewpoints, really) are
trivial and irrelevant when considered with regards to the macro-scale
scope of trends pertaining to houseplants everywhere. I‚Äôve done
nothing wrong and take full responsibility for having done/not done
so.

The remaining leaves and I look forward to the exciting
and challenging times ahead. I will water them tomorrow.

###### ![The old XcuseMe logo for android](assets/xcuseme/play-store-logo.png)
<caption text="The old XcuseMe logo that I made for the Play store. I stopped capitalizing the c at some point." />

I have worked on XcuseMe on and off for about two years now. I have very little to show for it: there are several bugs, there are no advanced features, there are very few basic features, there is no user base and there are no venture capitalists at my door (yet). But all is not in vain. I learned a lot about myself and about modern software development, some of which I will share here.

## Background

During the beginning of the pandemic, I downloaded a home workout app, called something like ‚Äú30 Day Full Body Workout.‚Äù You were supposed to do one workout a day for 30 days. It took me four months to complete it. Some days I ran or biked or hiked or did some other exercise. Other days, it was raining or I was hungover or I had to watch *Tiger King* instead. I wanted to know where those four months had gone. I needed some way to track my various exercises ‚Äî and my excuses! Thus, XcuseMe was born: ‚ÄúExercise tracking for real people.‚Äù

I envisioned it as a Strava for sane people, with optional social sharing and integrations with Garmin for exercises and GrubHub for excuses. I imagined a sophisticated ML algorithm that would offer non-judgmental advice and encouragement, like ‚ÄúYour last eight excuses have been about waking up too late. Maybe try exercising in the evening instead, you doorknob.‚Äù

Today, it is just a two-table CRUD app, but I use it almost every day. I can tell you exactly how many miles I ran in February, how long my cold lasted in March or how many times in the last year I was planning on working out right after work, but was too hungry  and then too full and then too high to do anything more than ten push-ups and one downward dog before bed (thirteen).

Yes, I could have used Excel for this or even just a notebook and a pen. But coding and learning new things is fun. Also, I still want to add some fancy algorithms one day, which would be a bit harder to do on a notebook.

## Version 1

###### ![A calendar with excuses marked in red and exercises in green](assets/xcuseme/calendar.jpg)
<caption text="Disclaimer: this is not actually a screenshot of version 1. It's version 4." />

Initially, I wanted XcuseMe to a) work offline, b) send daily reminder notifications and c) be optimized for mobile devices. Due to these ‚Äúrequirements,‚Äù I decided to make an app. Back then, I used an Android while most of my friends used iPhones. I would later guilt them into being beta testers, so I needed it to be cross-platform. I had read somewhere that React Native is slow, so I excitedly decided to learn how to use Flutter.

V1 turned out pretty okay. The Flutter docs were good. The development experience was good. Deploying to Google‚Äôs Play Store was okay. Deploying to Apple‚Äôs App Store was hell. I had to rope my Mac-using roommate into the whole endeavour to test, build and sign the app. There was a whole debacle trying to sign into my old Apple account without access to any of my old Apple products. They also have this weird beta release system that I submitted my app to, but the review process took so long that I released the app publicly instead. I still haven‚Äôt been approved for the beta system.

Anyway, I got ten or so of my friends to use it for a week or so. I conducted user research interviews and learned a lot. Some people wanted a social feed, some would hate a social feed. Some wanted to categorize their exercises, others wanted to track other goals besides exercising. Almost everyone wanted a daily reminder.

The main lesson that I learned was that the app was too damn simple. Very few people had any criticism to share about the app or user experience itself. All their feedback focused on things that were missing. As someone who doesn‚Äôt take criticism well, this was tough to hear. I had poured hours and hours and hours into this, from designing the flow and layout to learning a new language to wrangling with our tech overlords‚Äô deployment platforms. It was my child and it was perfect. How dare you suggest it needs more features! Don‚Äôt you understand how complex everything is!

## Version 2

###### ![A user interface for adding an excuse with the text of "Saw a cloud in the distance"](assets/xcuseme/add-excuse.png)
<caption text="Sometimes the weather outside is frightful." />

After the incredibly successful beta release and enlightening user feedback, I got to work on V2. Well, I may have taken a long break to brood. Regardless, I realized that any of these fancy advanced features would need a backend. (V1 used only on-device storage.) I decided to use Google‚Äôs Firebase and Firestore cloud platform things because they were tightly integrated with Flutter, offered offline support by default, and supported sending notifications

This refactor started out pretty well. I built some pretty snazzy signup and login flows. But the documentation definitely became more confusing. I felt like I was constantly jumping between Firestore docs and Flutter docs and Flutter-Firestore docs. Then Flutter 2 was released. It touted that it now had null safety. I like null safety,  so I spent a couple weekends trying to upgrade all my dependencies. This did not go smoothly at all. I feel like I was wasting my time trying to keep up with Google‚Äôs release cadence. I also feel like not building Dart with null safety from the very beginning was a massive oversight. Whatever.

Meanwhile, I had a bug. The details are unimportant, but it was essentially a state management problem. I‚Äôm a big fan of Elm and The Elm Architecture for managing state. I attempted to replicate this pattern in Flutter by using ‚ÄúStateless Widgets‚Äù everywhere possible and using Streams and Providers and Consumers to pass around state between child Widgets. This mostly worked out, until I needed a Widget with a text box. A text box in Flutter needs to be inside a Stateful Widget to keep track of the state of the text input. I was also passing an EventStream into this Widget, but since it was Stateful, it was not re-rendering when the stream was updated, meaning that this widget always had an empty list of events.

A smarter person might have figured it out or told me to use some other state management strategy, but I‚Äôm an idiot and prefer to be treated that way when I‚Äôm writing code. Flutter‚Äôs Stateless and Stateful Widget dichotomy is like colored async/sync functions, but 100 times worse.

(After this attempted debugging, I began to understand why so many Android apps are so frustratingly buggy. See, for example, the one where the keyboard won‚Äôt show up in Google‚Äôs texting app.)

So I was frustrated with this bug, bored by the null safety upgrade mess, and daunted by having to go through the release process again. I, if you will, fluttered away.

## Version 3

###### ![A pie chart showing the proportion of excuses and exercises](assets/xcuseme/pie-chart.jpg)

Like any savvy entrepreneur, I decided to re-write the entire thing, this time as a web application. I would lose the built-in offline support, but I was the only user at this point and I never really needed to use the app when I was deep in the woods. I would also lose convenient notifications, but I figured not paying Apple‚Äôs $125 annual developer fee would be worth it. I would use Elm for the front-end, of course, but I shopped around a bit for backends. After some deliberation, I decided to give Phoenix a shot. It seemed easy and powerful enough and it would be cool to learn, I thought.

I built V3 to be roughly on par with V1 and then didn‚Äôt touch it for months and months. I was really dragging my feet about re-creating the signup and login flows. I kept thinking that I should abandon the Phoenix framework and use Django instead to get that stuff out of the box. I wasn‚Äôt all too impressed with Phoenix in general and had no use for its killer LiveView feature. But I also know Django and Python fairly well, and I had accepted that if this side project wasn‚Äôt going to make me a millionaire, I should at least use it to learn new technologies. That‚Äôs what would keep me interested and motivated. Phoenix clearly didn‚Äôt, though I have nothing really bad to say about it.

## Version 4

###### ![A wordcloud showing the author's most frequent excuses](assets/xcuseme/wordcloud.jpg)
<caption text="I'm thinking about supporting frequent n-grams here too, but it's also fun to figure out why certain words like 'took' appear a lot. Hint: 'nap' is about the same size." />

Months later, I again re-wrote the entire application, this time using the [Haskell web framework IHP](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/) on the backend. I kept the front-end in Elm, but re-wrote it to not be a Single Page App because I had learned in other projects that managing routing on the client-side is a pain in the butt.

IHP has been fantastic. The documentation is solid, it‚Äôs easy to manage dependencies with Nix, I found a great tutorial on integrating with Elm, and deploying to IHP Cloud was a breeze (especially relative to the App Store). I encountered one problem with setting up a custom subdomain, but after reporting it, it was fixed within a couple of days, with a friendly reply from the CEO (Google could never).

On the downside, I have had to fight against the framework in some places in order to write the front-end almost entirely in Elm. IHP encourages you to use their hsx language and auto-generated forms rather than a separate front-end. I respect that design decision, but after I discovered elm-ui, I refuse to write CSS in my free time. My decision to lean heavily into Elm meant that there were some issues with redirects and rendering JSON responses, but I‚Äôve managed.

Best of all, I‚Äôm finally learning Haskell and I‚Äôm loving its type safety and idiot-proofness. Having a compiler tell me what stupid bugs I‚Äôve written is so relaxing. When my code eventually compiles, I am very confident that it will work. Likewise with Elm, of course.

## Conclusion

I still don‚Äôt have notifications or a social feed or ML algorithms, but I do have:

- one very dedicated daily active user
- experience with three new languages and three new frameworks
- A pretty cool word cloud of my excuses
- No stupid Stateful Widgets
- No CSS
- One long blog post
- Happiness?

If you‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre now legally obligated to log your exercise and excuses every day on XcuseMe ([https://xcuseme.ihpapp.com](https://xcuseme.ihpapp.com)). Enjoy!

###### ![beantown](assets/bean.jpg)

Boston has for too long been an after-thought of a city. It is not the pinnacle of American civilization that we all know it could be. Yet!

In the same way that I, as a child, learned everything that I know from my older neighbor Mr. Brommel (who, incidentally, was recently arrested for attempting to smuggle a giraffe out of the Bronx zoo), so too can Boston learn from its more prosperous, more renowned and more reputable neighbor city, namely, New York, New York. As Mr. Brommel used to say, before his death in police custody, ‚ÄúGood artists imitate; great artists steal giraffes.‚Äù So, Boston, in our quest to be the best city in America, nay, the world, let‚Äôs take a page out of our biggest competitor‚Äôs notebook, or, if you will, a giraffe out of their zoo.

## Step One: Rebranding

Boston‚Äôs nickname is Beantown. New York City‚Äôs is The Big Apple. See the difference? No? Please allow me to expound.

First, NYC has an article. It‚Äôs *The* Big Apple, not Big Apple or A Big Apple. Thus, revision one of Boston‚Äôs nickname: The Beantown. A definite article for the definitive city.

Second, NYC has an adjective denoting its size: big. Boston has none, yet. The Big Beantown certainly has a nice alliterative ring to it, but we‚Äôre Boston, home to the finest universities in the world. We have big vocabularies and big thesauri. We can go bigger than big. Revision 2: The Enormous Beantown. Getting better.

Third, it‚Äôs The Big Apple, not The Big Apple City. Sounds silly, right? Let‚Äôs nix the ‚Äútown.‚Äù We‚Äôre not a town anymore anyways!

Boston: The Enormous Bean.

## Step Two: Environmental Enhancements

New York is a world-class city with a world-class ecological footprint. Its two major rivers, the Hudson River and the East River, are some of the most polluted in the world. There are countless memes, sketches and jokes about their world-famous toxicity. No one dares to kayak in them, let alone swim. Boston may have the occasional algae bloom, but for most of the year Bostonians make a mockery of the Charles River with their insipid paddling, silly sailing and drunken plunges. A respectable city has respectable rivers, ones its residents know are not to be trifled with. It‚Äôs no wonder why New York‚Äôs East River has dolphins while Boston has none.

Luckily, it will be very easy for The Enormous Bean to catch up with The Big Apple. From Waltham onward, we must divert all of our sewage into the Charles. NYC only pollutes its rivers when heavy rain overflows their drainage system. In Boston, we can make it constant.

Besides attracting more dolphins to the area, this step of the plan will also ease the gentrification of the uppity Charles River-adjacent neighborhoods of Cambridgeport, Charlestown and Beacon Hill by making them smell worse. Win-win.

## Step Three: Scaffolding

This step should be obvious to anyone who has ever stepped foot in Manhattan. Scaffolding! Everywhere you turn, there‚Äôs scaffolding. You can‚Äôt walk down a single block without passing underneath scaffolding. New York City‚Äôs scaffolding is mostly there to present the illusion of a city hard at work building, improving, constructing, growing. But the scaffolding is also useful pedestrian infrastructure in all seasons. Scaffolding offers shelter from winter snow, guards against spring rain, provides shade on hot summer days, and is perfect for hanging spooky decorations in the fall.

On a good week, downtown Boston might have one or two buildings with scaffolding up , but we should strive for ‚ÄúVision 100‚Äù - the elimination of scaffold-free sidewalks. Imagine a city with plentiful shade on both sides of the sidewalk. Dream, for a moment, of how industrious we would appear to tourists. We have a long way to go, but, as Mr. Brommel used to say, ‚ÄúThe best day for a zoo heist was yesterday. The second best is today.‚Äù

## Conclusion

Ever since the rabble-rousing, despot-defying, democracy-defining tea partiers began throwing their tea parties, Boston has been putting the elite in coastal and the coastal in elite. And yet, like so many first children, we haven‚Äôt gotten all the love we deserve. With your help and these three simple steps outlined above, we can finally get it and be the best city in the world, The Enormous Bean.

**I.**

We arrived at our gate in the Boston airport an hour and a half early. The terminal was crowded, but we found three seats in a row facing a dividing wall. Blocking our path to these seats was a long white charger that stretched from an outlet in the dividing wall to the phone in the hands of its hunched-over owner. The charger came to about half-way up my calf. To reach the seats, we each (Steven, then me, then Carter) had to lift our carry-on and step carefully over the charger. The owner of the charger appeared utterly unperturbed.

Once we sat down and put down our bags, Carter went looking for food, stepping carefully over the charger on his way out. He returned and went back over the charger. I left to fill up my water bottle, going back and forth over the charger. Steven filled his. I drank too much of mine and left to use the bathroom, over and back over the charger. Steven and I played cards. I went to refill my water bottle, over the charger, over the charger.

Finally, we were called to the desk at the gate to have our passports and vaccination cards examined. We picked up our bags and left one by one over the charger, over the charger, over the charger. After our passports were checked, we found different seats.

_Moral: Animals, even semi-domesticated ones, are incredibly adaptive to changes in their natural environment._

Shar had arrived at the Airbnb first. She let us in, we picked rooms, found a restaurant for dinner on the internet and waited half an hour for SriRaam to arrive. He took a quick shower and then we left. After dinner, we went to a bar. Brianne and Terry, whose flight had been delayed, meet us there. They had dropped off their bags at the Airbnb first, though, and Terry had showered. He informed us that he had ‚Äúkind of‚Äù flooded the bathroom and that the floor might be wet.

After one drink, Carter and I left to go to bed. When we entered the apartment, we learned that the floor was indeed wet. There was a pool of water in the hallway outside of one bathroom. An entire roll of paper towels was floating in the pool. The floor in the bathroom was also wet. I dried it and then tested the shower. There didn‚Äôt seem to be any leaks, so I figured that Terry must have opened the shower door and directed the hand-held shower head at the floor. Carter, meanwhile, was singing away in the other shower.

I waited for the water to heat up and got in. The shower, by the way, was a fancy one with one hand-held shower head and one overhead ‚Äúwaterfall‚Äù head. The floor of the shower was level with that of the bathroom, but angled slighted down towards a long rectangular drain. At the bottom of the glass door was a rubber lining, presumably to keep the shower water-tight. As I showered, the water level at my feet rose slowly, but I kept a close eye on the floor outside the shower and saw no spills. I lathered my hair with shampoo and switched on the waterfall shower head. After a long day of flying and stepping over chargers, it felt divine. The increased pressure immediately flooded the shower, bathroom and hallway. _Ah, Terry isn‚Äôt an idiot_, I thought. _I am_.

With the shampoo still in my hair, I dried the floor again. Then I carefully finished showering, keeping the water pressure as low as possible.

By the end of our stay, we had also clogged the other shower drain.

_Moral: German-engineered shower drains are no match for non-German hair._

A couple of hours into the train ride from Berlin to Amsterdam, I walked down to the cafe car to get lunch. As usual, I scanned the menu for the vegan options and picked the first one - a ‚ÄúWrap Sweet Chili‚Äù. The German and English menus both called it that. I guess it‚Äôs sort of like how there‚Äôs no English word for ‚Äútaco‚Äù, except it doesn‚Äôt make sense.

Anyway, I ordered the Wrap Sweet Chili _bitte_. The man asked, ‚ÄúWhat time?‚Äù

Maybe they would deliver it to my seat at my preferred time. _That‚Äôs a cool idea,_ I thought, _but I‚Äôm hungry_. ‚ÄúNow?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNo, what time? One, two,‚Ä¶?‚Äù the man replied.

It was already 3 pm. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù I said.

Then it clicked. ‚ÄúOh! How many? Just one please.‚Äù

The wrap was pretty good, one of the best vegan Wrap Sweet Chili‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever had. I went a second time to get another.

_Moral: Communicating with other humans is difficult, especially if their only shared language doesn‚Äôt make any sense anyway._

**IV.**

On our third day in Amsterdam, Brianne bought seven tickets for us to go on a canal cruise at 3 pm. Before the cruise, we wanted to go to the Van Gogh museum which was only a few minutes walk from the docks. Carter had already been to the museum, so he said he would just meet us at the cruise. Unfortunately, the Van Gogh museum was sold out for the day. There were, however, many other museums in the square. We split up - three people to the modern art museum and three to the Rijksmuseum. I was in the latter group. It was a little after 2 pm by the time we got in line, not enough time to get our money‚Äôs worth in the museum before the cruise, but we could come back after. In line, however, we learned that there was no re-entry allowed. We went to the free sculpture garden instead.

At 2:45, we made our way to the docks. One canal cruise company had a storefront and a clearly designated dock. We quickly realized that we were with a different company at some other dock. The website said it was to the right of the Rijksmuseum, but didn‚Äôt specify if that was when you were looking at the museum from the dock or at the dock from the museum. At last, we spotted a boat with the name of our company on it. We went down to that dock. The boat was full, so we figured it must not be ours. It left around 2:55. We later realized that it was our boat. There was no signage or communication whatsoever.

Another boat arrived and a group of well dressed people who obviously knew each other began boarding. That must have been a private tour, so not ours either. A third boat arrived and even better dressed people got on. Not ours. These boats both left around 3:10. There were no other boats arriving, but, reassuringly, there were now a few other groups of confused tourists on the dock. Brianne called the company to try to figure out where our boat was. SriRaam and I walked over to another dock where a boat owned by the same company had just pulled up. We asked the captain where the 3 o‚Äôclock cruise was and if it was his boat. He told us, rudely, that he didn‚Äôt know and that it had nothing to do with him.

The person who Brianne talked to told us to wait to see if there was room on the 3:30 boat and that if that didn‚Äôt work, we could try the 4 o‚Äôclock one next. We waited. Shar left because she had to meet a friend at 4:30. Carter had been running too late to catch the 3 o‚Äôclock boat, so had given up on the venture entirely. Soon, the 3:30 boat arrived. We informed the very nice captain and first mate of our troubles. They said they would let everyone with tickets for the 3:30 cruise board first and then see if there was room for the seven of us.

‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre only 5 now,‚Äù we said.

‚ÄúDid the other two drown?‚Äù they asked.

‚ÄúYes, tragically,‚Äù we said.

All the properly ticketed customers got on and the boat looked very full. ‚ÄúCould everyone please squeeze together to make some more room please?‚Äù the co-captain shouted.

Everyone squeezed together and the five of us squeezed in as well and we all enjoyed a lovely cruise through the canals.

_Moral: If you need to get a Covid test to enter the U.S., schedule it for before your canal cruise._

Quick! Name a market category that Amazon doesn‚Äôt have its hands in.

Okay, fine, they, thankfully, discontinued the Fire Phone. And yes, maybe you came up with something else, but odds are that that category is either already dominated by some other evil oligopoly or that there will soon be an Amazon Basics version of it. Amazon‚Äôs reach is enormous. AWS cloud hosting has 34% of the market share (~9 million live websites). 4.1% of all consumer goods are sold on amazon dot com, 11.3% of books are bought for Kindle,\* there‚Äôs probably an Alexa or two in your home, or maybe a Ring doorbell on your door. Look outside and count the number of Amazon boxes in sight.

Plenty of others have written all about the evils of Amazon‚Äôs extensive tendrils. I will add only one more here: as a software engineer, some mornings I struggle to navigate a horribly designed user interface in the AWS console, and then, breaking for lunch, I struggle with the horribly designed user interface of my Whole Foods red pepper flakes. The holes in the top are smaller than the flakes!

The recently released Season 3\*\* of ‚ÄúThe Boys‚Äù on Amazon Prime does an excellent job of highlighting the dangers of an all-powerful, all-encompassing, tendril-y evil monopoly. The evil dealings of the Vought Corporation and its employees are broadcast to the public on the Vought News Network. Hughie and co. plot against the Vought CEO using their Vought phones. Everyone drinks Vought branded plastic water bottles. The show almost, almost seems to understand the irony.

But then, die-hard, down-with-Vought-even-no-especially-if-it-kills-me Billy Butcher orders a present for his sort-of adopted ‚Äúnephew‚Äù on‚Ä¶ Amazon! In the writers‚Äô defense, maybe they wanted this scene to reflect the way that many people would buy Connect 4 today. But, really, this scene shrieks of weird, self-indulging product placement. For a show whose central theme is the corruption and evilness of a corporation to portray the use of technology from an evil, corrupt company without any comment is hard to understand, until you realize that it‚Äôs the very same company producing the show. It makes the criticism of Vought fall a bit flat.

Before this scene, it‚Äôs easy to imagine that Vought is a satirical stand-in for Amazon: evil mega-corporation, check; run by an egotistical bald man, check; has deep, questionable ties with the federal government, check; sells everything, check; promotes its image through its own movie and television studios, check; frequently causes people to die horrible, bloody deaths, check? But then Butcher uses Amazon, so it also exists in this world and, unbelievably, hasn‚Äôt gotten into the unethical business of manufacturing supes. Imagine how much more efficient its warehouses would be with Temp-V-ed up Fulfillment Associates!


_\* Most of these statistics are made up._

_\*\* Yeah, maybe the first two seasons do too, but I just thought of this after starting the third._

1. What is the relationship between the latitude at which a migrating goose summers and the total number of miles that it flies south for the winter? Like, if you‚Äôre a goose living in New Jersey for most of the year, when it gets cold, how far are you flying? Florida? North Carolina? Or North Carolina for December and then Florida when North Carolina gets too cold? What if you spend your summers in DC? Straight to Florida at the first frost? Do all the migrating geese on the East Coast end up in Florida? Does Florida have that level of goose capacity? Isn‚Äôt it a little unfair that a Maine goose would have to fly so much farther than a New Jersey goose? Alternatively, if they all fly the same amount, a Maine goose might end up in New Jersey, while a New Jersey goose ends up in Florida. If New Jersey‚Äôs winter was too cold for the New Jersey goose, won‚Äôt it also be too cold for the Maine goose? Or are the geese more concerned with the relative temperature difference between their summer and winter homes, the way that a human from Maine might conceivably enjoy New Jersey‚Äôs milder winters? Also to consider, of course, is the latitude-dependent temporal variance in the onset of the seasons. Cold weather begins in Maine far before cold weather begins in Virginia, potentially giving the Maine goose enough of a head start to beat the Virginian geese to the best ponds of Georgia, which might in turn force the Virginian geese farther south, thus evening out the number of miles flown by both sets of geese. Yet, for a Maine goose to arrive in Georgia before a Virginian goose, the Mainer would have had to fly past the Virginian, who was not yet cold enough to start flying to Georgia. If Virginia wasn‚Äôt yet cold enough to drive its geese away, why wouldn‚Äôt the Maine goose settle in Virginia until it did? What (or who) would compel it farther south than the weather by itself dictates? This is to say nothing of the effects of climate change, non-migratory northern geese, non-migratory southern geese, or water-fowl in general. Again, what is the relationship between the latitude at which a migrating goose summers and the total number of miles it flies south for winter?! And why is no one looking into this?!

Tom√°s Belvittle was an unobservant man. On this particular misty Sunday morning, he had failed to observe three crucial things. First, the used pregnancy test in his bathroom‚Äôs trash can. Second, the gradual loosening of his left shoelace as he continued along his run. And third, the hearse that had been following him since he left home.

A large crack appeared in the sidewalk in front of him. Tom√°s stutter-stepped to avoid it, but in doing so, stepped on his loose lace. He stumbled, and then, slipping on the wet concrete, fell. Crack! His head landed sharply on the sidewalk‚Äôs edge. Blood rushed out.

The hearse pulled up beside him silently. Two dark-clad men got out, retrieved a coffin from the back, laid it next to Tom√°s‚Äôs limp form, lifted up its lid, gently placed the body within, closed the lid and returned the coffin to the hearse. One man started the engine, while the other rinsed the blood off the sidewalk with a gallon of spring water. The second man returned again to the hearse and they drove off.

\*\*\*

Marie Belvittle, on the other hand, was a very observant woman. She noticed, for example, the slight and recent change in their cat‚Äôs mood and appetite. The cat, Susan, was indeed three weeks pregnant, but the test result was negative. Marie didn‚Äôt know this, but human pregnancy tests don‚Äôt work on cats.

Marie also noticed that her husband was late returning from his run. She logged in to his Strava to see where he was. He had kept a steady pace for the first six miles, but after that, there was no more data. She knew he had charged his watch last night, so the battery couldn‚Äôt have died. Besides, why wasn‚Äôt he home yet? She grew more worried by the minute.

For ten minutes, she paced patiently near the door. With still no sign of Tom√°s, she scribbled out a note‚Äî*Gone looking for you. Taking Susie Pants with me. If you see this, call me <3.* She wished desperately that he would start running with his phone. She put on her and Susan‚Äôs raincoats, unlocked her bike from the front porch, placed Susan in the basket and pedaled away.

\*\*\*

Tom√°s woke up in the dark with a throbbing headache. He was still wet from the sweat and damp air. He shivered. He tried to reach down to pull his blankets back up, but there were no blankets; he was trapped in a coffin in the back of a hearse. His head banged sharply into the coffin‚Äôs lid. He fell back into unconsciousness.

\*\*\*

The man in the passenger seat of the hearse turned to the driver. ‚ÄúDid you hear that?" he asked.

‚ÄúJust another pothole, Steve. Nothing to worry about," replied the driver.

Steve was worried, but said nothing. He had a bad feeling about this one.

‚ÄúYou get a bad feeling every time. It‚Äôll be fine. Always is,‚Äù said the driver.

\*\*\*

Marie and Susan reached the spot where Tom√°s had fallen. Susan jumped out and began lapping at a puddle on the sidewalk. She had been so thirsty recently. The puddle tasted fresh, but with a slight aftertaste of iron. The cat was unable to explain this to Marie. Fortunately though, Marie noticed something was off about the puddle. It was a misty, foggy morning, but it hadn‚Äôt really rained. There were no other puddles in sight. She knelt and tasted it herself.

‚ÄúHuh. Tastes like spring water. Poland Spring, maybe? Wait, no, it‚Äôs Kirkland,‚Äù she said to the cat.

She had some more. ‚ÄúAnd, hmm, can I taste a hint of a Tom√°s‚Äôs Centrum Adult Two-A-Day Gummy Multivitamins for Men-fortified blood?‚Äù

She couldn‚Äôt. It was Tom√°s‚Äôs blood, but Marie wouldn‚Äôt have been able to tell the difference between his blood or anyone else's. And she certainly couldn‚Äôt taste his multivitamins. Those went in and out without ever getting absorbed into his bloodstream. Regardless, Marie knew something bad had happened.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go, darling,‚Äù she said. They left, continuing along Tom√°s‚Äôs planned route.

\*\*\*

Again, Tom√°s woke up in the dark. Remembering what happened last time, he wiggled cautiously, trying to get his bearings. The coffin was the perfect size. He could barely move his arms an inch. The lid, as his head had observed, was hard, but the part he lay in was soft and plush. *I was on a run and I fell and now I am trapped in a soft box*, he thought. *I am trapped in a soft box. Someone put me in a soft box. I‚Äôm going to die in this soft box and never see Susan again. They stuck me in a soft box and I‚Äôm going to die without ever seeing my dear sweet Susie Poo again. Or my wife,* he thought, growing more worried.

The hearse hit a pothole, sending Tom√°s‚Äôs head careening into the hard side of his soft box, knocking him out, again.

\*\*\*

In the passenger seat, Steve grimaced.

‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù said the driver. ‚ÄúJust potholes.‚Äù

They had reached their destination. The hearse slowed down and pulled into the funeral home‚Äôs driveway. The two men got out. The driver went to the back and opened the trunk, but Steve walked past, heading for the cemetery across the street. ‚ÄúI need a smoke,‚Äù he called. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ahead of schedule anyway.‚Äù

The driver nodded and leaned against the hearse. *He sure did need a smoke. Nervous little bugger,* he thought. He checked his watch. ‚ÄúTen minutes, Steve. Then we‚Äôve got to start embalming!‚Äù he shouted. They couldn‚Äôt let the body get too cold.

\*\*\*

At that very moment, Marie biked past the funeral home. *Embalming?* she thought. *How gross.* She shuddered. Susan purred unhappily. At the corner, the light changed to red. Marie coasted to a stop and glanced back at the funeral home. The huge billboard above it caught her eye. In a garish pink, it read: Mack O‚ÄôDonnell‚Äôs Family Funeral Home EXPRESS: *Die tomorrow, get buried today!* Call 467-0311 for appointments.

*Well that‚Äôs* o*minous,* she thought. She hated when companies left out their area code in advertisements, as if everyone was a local. *But wait a minute, that number looks familiar.* She took out her phone and checked the recent calls list. She had three missed calls from a number that ended the same way. The area code wasn‚Äôt the standard one for the city, but the newer one that had just been introduced. *Idiots*. There was a voicemail too. *Ugh. Who leaves voicemails anymore?*

The light changed and a car behind her honked. Susan growled menacingly. Marie hopped off her bike and moved to the sidewalk.

\*\*\*

In the cemetery, Steve was sitting atop a mausoleum. He had worked his pre-roll down to a roach and was starting to feel like himself again. *Embalming time, embalming time*, he hummed.

\*\*\*

Marie couldn‚Äôt remember her voicemail passcode. It had been a while. She had one more attempt left before she would be locked out for five minutes. The fog had grown denser and fat drops of rain began to fall noisily. Marie pulled up Susan‚Äôs hood to protect her from the rain. *Oh, duh. Susan!* Marie typed in 78726#. ‚ÄúYou have one new voicemail,‚Äù the machine said. ‚ÄúPress 1 to listen now. Press 2 for more options. Press 3 to repeat this menu.‚Äù Marie pressed 1.

\*\*\*

Steve flicked the end of the joint into a nearby rosebush and jumped to the ground. He skipped happily across the street.

‚ÄúQuit skipping,‚Äù said the driver. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be the director one day and I‚Äôll be goddamned if any son of mine gets a reputation for jollity. Act professional. Frown for once.‚Äù

Steve rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúDad. Ease up. This will be a fun one. We haven‚Äôt had anyone in such good shape for a while now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne hit of the marijuana and all your worries wash away, huh? I swear that drug‚Äôs no good for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you the one complaining about me being too nervous earlier? Make up your mind old man!‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ‚Äòold man‚Äô me! I‚Äôll show you what an old man can do!‚Äù

‚ÄúKidding, dad. Jeez.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, son. Help me get this out then. We need to keep to schedule.‚Äù

\*\*\*

‚ÄúHello. This is Mack O‚ÄôDonnell Junior calling on behalf of Mack O‚ÄôDonnell‚Äôs Family Funeral Home EXPRESS: *Die tomorrow, get buried today!* I‚Äôm calling today to confirm an express funeral you or a loved one recently scheduled for Thomas Velmittle for this coming Sunday. In order to cancel, please call us back promptly at 467-0311. That‚Äôs 467-0311. Have a nice day!‚Äù

Marie dropped her phone. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got the wrong man, Susan!‚Äù she cried.

She grabbed her bike in one hand and her cat in the other and raced madly to the funeral home.

Steve and the driver, his father, the funeral director, Mack O‚ÄôDonnell, Jr., or ‚ÄúJunior‚Äù to his friends, had just then maneuvered the coffin out of the hearse. Without slowing down, Marie let go of her bike, propelling it towards Steve. At the same time, she brandished the cat at the older man. Susan growled menacingly, right on cue. Startled, both men dropped the coffin, causing its lid to pop open.

Tom√°s, awake again, decided that he had died. He began to scream, unintelligibly at first and then more clearly for his dear old cat and dear young wife. Together, Marie and Steve shut the coffin‚Äôs lid.

‚ÄúListen here,‚Äù Marie began. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the wrong man. That‚Äôs my husband in that box. His name is Tom√°s Belvittle. You‚Äôve got an appointment for *Thomas Velmittle*. I don‚Äôt know who this Thomas fellow is, but I‚Äôd like my husband back please.‚Äù

Mack O‚ÄôDonnell, Jr. muttered something to himself and pulled out a small black appointment book. He flipped through it slowly, muttering all the while. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHmm. I see. Well, I‚Äôm afraid we made a terrible mistake. That was quite the mix-up. Thomas‚Äôs appointment isn‚Äôt until next week anyway. My sincerest apologies.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre terribly sorry for any pain and suffering we may have caused. You have our deepest sympathies,‚Äù added Steve with the deadly conviction of a true funeral home director. He winked at his father, who nodded approvingly.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Marie, not entirely convinced. She opened the coffin and helped Tom√°s out. He stopped screaming; they embraced tenderly.

The rain picked up again. Mack O‚ÄôDonnell, Jr. glanced upwards. *Shame*, he thought, *would have been a great day for a funeral.* He turned to the re-united couple. ‚ÄúCan we at least offer you a ride home?‚Äù

Tom√°s was in no state to take the bus alone, so Marie nodded. They loaded the coffin, bike and cat into the hearse and climbed in.

It was a quiet ride.

Marie, Tom√°s and Susan got out and Marie thanked them for the ride.

‚ÄúOh, and,‚Äù she said, turning back, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a damn how ‚ÄúEXPRESS‚Äù your funerals are. You can‚Äôt go around murdering people.‚Äù

Mack and Steve nodded solemnly.

‚ÄúAnd one more thing, too! Put your full phone number on your billboard. There‚Äôs certainly enough room for it!‚Äù

## Epilogue

Moved by her love, aided by her excellent observational skills, helped by her dear cat and assisted by no small amount of luck, Marie Belvittle was able to rescue her husband from a gruesome and painful death at the hands of Mack and Steve O‚ÄôDonnell of Mack O‚ÄôDonnell‚Äôs Family Funeral Home EXPRESS. Yet not all endings are as happy.

Mary Velmittle, Thomas‚Äôs sister, was of no help whatsoever when Thomas was kidnapped, embalmed and buried alive the following week.

Two weeks later, Susan miscarried. The veterinarian thought it might have been caused by too much stress.

Steve O‚ÄôDonnell was caught smoking pot in the cemetery and sentenced to life in prison. Mack, distraught over the fact that no one would be able to continue the family business, hung himself. His daughter, Jessica, continued the family business anyway. She went on to arrange the express funerals of hundreds more people, whether they were ready for it or not.

Tom√°s, perhaps shaken by his near-death experience, started to notice the little details of life, like his wife‚Äôs stockpile of pregnancy tests. Tom√°s was infertile ever since an operation years prior and he knew they didn‚Äôt work on cats, so why would Marie need to know if she was pregnant? There were other details, too: the lack of a wedding ring on Marie‚Äôs finger, boxers that weren‚Äôt his in the laundry, a strange man in their bed. He filed for divorce. A judge granted Marie joint-custody of Susan, whose once peaceful life was upended by constantly moving back and forth between homes. She was never the same.

Last November, my mom, as she passed me her phone, told me that Grandmom had been hacked. "Go help," she said.

Several minutes and one intense interrogation later, I learned that Grandmom had read an email stating that her credit card had been hacked and that she needed to reset it immediately. I thought this smelled a bit phishy. "Who was the email from?" I asked.

"I don't know. I don't have it," Grandmom replied.

Uh oh. Time for an over-the-phone debugging session.

Slowly, we navigated to her inbox. Slowly, we found the search bar. Nope, not that one. The smaller one inside the page. The page? Yeah, like the specific website, not the browser. Browser? Yeah, you know like the thing you use to go to the internet? Oh, Google. Sure, yeah. But do you see the search box right above the list of emails? There's nothing to the right, just something on top. Yes.

We searched for "hack", "credit card", and "reset". The email wasn't there. Maybe it was archived. We went to the archive. Nothing. Maybe it was deleted? Nope. Spam? No, Pam hasn't emailed me in years.

Things weren't going well. "You know what," I said, "how about I log in to your email so I can look for it myself?"

She thought that was a swell idea. Okay, what's your email? Got it. And what's your password? A password? No, I don't have one. You must have a password. How do you sign in to your email? It's just there. But what if you get a new computer? You must have had a password at some point. No, I just open Google and it's there.

I hadn't the phone back to my mom. "Tell her she's been hacked and can't access the internet anymore."

**Morals**:

1. Keeping users logged in indefinitely may reduce friction in accessing your service, but might convince them that they don't have a password.
2. No matter how much you fine-tune your UX, your website is inherently hostile to certain users. Grandmom doesn't care how good your search autocomplete is. She's typing in the wrong window.
3. The only part of this that would be solved by web3 is that if you added Grandmom to the blockchain, all her assets would actually be stolen and no one would bother with sending her phishing emails anymore.

It has lately come to my attention that certain unnamed members of the household community have not been doing their utmost to ensure that the apartment is kept in a most harmonious and habitable condition. I have much respect for you, my co-inhabitants, and your varying needs, interests, desires, aptitudes, personalities and personal defects. So great is my respect that it is with tremendous hesitancy that I proceed, but proceed I must. In order to ameliorate and put cease to the deteriorating conditions of life in our home, I have drawn up these terms, a "Roommate Agreement", if you will. Upon receipt, please read and sign the agreement within two days. Together, we can make this home a home.

## Section 1: General Cleanliness

To be fair, you guys are actually pretty clean. Maybe help with the sweeping once in a while. Other than that, keep it up!

## Section 2: Routine Chores

Screw systems and fuck routines! Let's just communicate and get shit done as needed. I think it's working so far.

## Section 3: Bird Protocol

This section outlines some common-sense protocols for dealing with birds.

### Subsection A: Protocol for Birds Encountered in the Exterior of the Living Premises

If you have occasion to leave the living premises, meaning herein the apartment and interior common areas, including but not limited to entryways, stairwells, and basements, and if, upon such an occasion, you encounter or set sights upon a bird, please do the following:

1. In accordance with local ordinances, do not feed any water fowl. If you are unsure if the bird is a member of a species of water fowl, the easiest way to find out is to feed it. If you promptly receive a fine from the local Department of Parks and Recreation, it is a water fowl.
2. Do not touch, grab, ensnare, entrap, or otherwise engage with the bird, especially with the intent to capture it.
3. You may quack at the bird.


### Subsection B: Protocol for Birds Encountered upon the Thresholds of the Living Premises

DO NOT AFFORD ACCESS TO A BIRD ENCOUNTERED UPON THE THRESHOLDS OF THE LIVING PREMISES. Close the window, door or flue which gates access to the threshold upon which the bird seeks to gain access to the living premises. Importantly, if the bird is encountered in the midst of its egress from the premises, close the door/window/flue in such a way that allows the bird to continue its egress. Do not impede a leaving bird from leaving. We wish the bird to leave; a leaving bird is on our side.

### Subsection C: Protocol for Birds Encountered in the Interior of the Living Premises

In the event that a bird gains ingress to the living premises of our home (may this happen with considerable infrequency), please do the following:

1. Encourage and allow the bird to leave the premises with deliberate haste. Open exterior doors and windows in the room in which the bird resides. Close doors leading further into the premises. When opening such portals, take care to not permit the further ingress of additional birds (see Subsection B).
2. If the bird appears docile and non-threatening, and is of reasonable size, say, smaller than an albatross, then a shoo-ing motion or feigned kick may be undertaken to further encourage the bird's egress.
3. Before the bird leaves, take note of its general qualities, size, color and demeanor. This will be useful in communicating to others about the severity of the bird incident. If there are several birds involved, also note their number. Attempt also to identify the species of bird. It may behoove your memory to take a picture of the bird.
4. Shortly after the bird's departure, attempt to ascertain the method of the bird's ingress. Are there open windows? Doors? Gaping, albatross-shaped holes in the wall? Birds are untidy animals. It may have left droppings or feathers. These clues may provide a path leading to the bird's method of ingress. This path is best followed when fresh.
5. Clean up the goddamn bird poop!!

WASHINGTON, D.C. ‚Äî In sharp contrast to its sluggishness over the past decade, a sharply divided Congress momentarily set aside its differences and moved the new climate-and-abortion bill from committee to Biden's desk in just four days. Biden is expected to sign the bill into law early tomorrow morning.

The bill, which overrides the Supreme Court's pro-abortion ruling in Roe v. Wade, while offering an exception to certain climate-conscious, electric vehicle-owning mothers, is seen as an exciting win for both parties. For years, the religious right has sought to protect the lives of the innocent unborn and also curtail the rights of women. Meanwhile, enterprising Democrats have recently been maneuvering to profit from growing calls to save our warming planet from impending doom. The bill, known as America's Moral Compromise Act or AMCA, neatly solves both of these strategic objectives.

"Look, we'll concede that abortion is murder, which, in a lot of cases, to a lot of people, specifically, to a lot of my constituents, is morally wrong, murder that is, is wrong" Senator Amy Klobuchar (D., MINN) explained. "But, on the other hand, driving an electric vehicle is morally good. Two wrongs and all that, as they say."

AMCA passed 378 to 48 in the House of Representatives. Of those opposed, most were moderates in either party who were upset that they could no longer campaign on being the only ones willing to compromise. Those not present during the vote were reportedly out buying electric vehicles for their mistresses. In the Senate, it passed with a shocking 99 yeas. The lone dissenter, Senator Joe Manchin (D?, W.Va.), cited his undying support for women in the coal industry.

In an press conference with Senator Mitch McConnell (R. Ky), when asked how the legislation had been able to move so quickly through Congress, he said, "Well, with Robinhood, it's never been easier to buy and sell stocks, straight from your smartphone. For example, I was able to buy 2,000 shares of Tesla in just 10 minutes yesterday."

In a joint statement, Planned Parenthood, Greenpeace and the Catholic Church said, "At least it's something, we guess."

At press time, rumors began to spread of singer B√òRNS (of "Electric Love" fame) appearing at Biden's signing tomorrow.

ALBANY, NY ‚Äî As we near the second* anniversary of the start of the pandemic in the United States, Americans are at long last beginning to feel hope again. Vaccines have drastically reduced death rates;  the worst of the Omicron wave seems to be behind us; mask mandates are beginning to be lifted; at-home tests are widely available; things might be okay. In other news, a new variant of concern, designated Upsilon, is being closely monitored by the World Health Organization (WHO) as it rampages through South America.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul recently ended the state‚Äôs mask-or-vaccine requirement, providing a strong example for other liberal totalitarian democratic regimes across the country to follow suit. This action and other plans to lift COVID-19 restrictions elsewhere is kindling in many citizens a funny feeling they once recognized as hope.

Also, the surviving members of the WHO team in Bolivia have stressed that the new variant is deadlier than the original and more contagious than Omicron.

‚ÄúI was going for a walk yesterday and I passed someone in the street and I had this weird like sort of warm and like fuzzy feeling in my stomach and it made me smile. I don't really know why,‚Äù reported one slightly confused New Yorker, who, for the first time in two* years, had perceived another human as something other than a vector of disease. ‚ÄúThat feeling is what we used to call hope,‚Äù our reporter helpfully explained.

Some readers may recall experiencing such a feeling at the end of the first, second, third or fourth wave of the novel coronavirus, or maybe when Joe Biden won the election, or maybe after receiving their first, second or third vaccine. This time, ‚Äúsomething's different," according to Professor Sandra Jones of Columbia University's School of Epidemiology and Self-Deception.

‚ÄúOther hopes have indeed flown before, yet we're now at a uniquely opportune moment in our journey through this pandemic as a nation, as a state, and as individuals. We're vaccinated and boosted, we have effective therapeutics, our hospitals are ready, our health care system is more resilient than ever, our immune systems are more resilient than ever, case rates are plummeting. I have strong reason to believe that the pandemic is almost over, and for good this time,‚Äù she stated.

Meanwhile, the government of Chile is asking citizens who become infected with Upsilon to avoid the overrun hospitals and instead escort themselves to the nearest mass grave site.

‚ÄúI don't know what came over me, but I just made concrete plans to see a friend in three weeks," said another confused New Yorker. ‚ÄúI'm even thinking about a vacation! I've heard the Andes are nice this time of year."

‚ÄúDid you get any avocados?" I asked.

‚ÄúNo. Was I supposed to?‚Äù Steven replied.

‚ÄúNo. I just wanted one."

‚ÄúYou should have said something then."

‚ÄúYeah. It's okay. I'll get some myself."

To be fair, that wasn't the stupidest conversation ever. It was mostly just boring. I should never have asked about the avocados. I should have gotten off my lazy ass and looked in the damn fruit bowl. Steven is too kind. Steven, if you're reading this, next time I ask about the avocados, try saying, ‚ÄúGet off your lazy ass and look in the damn fruit bowl yourself." Keep it interesting.

Regardless, we didn't have any avocados at home. So, the next day, after I realized that HomeGoods had neither knife sharpeners nor collapsible hampers nor humidifiers, and after feeling quite silly for taking a fifteen minute detour to HomeGoods for such items when I could have just stayed on my lazy ass and looked at their damn website first, and since I was feeling a bit peckish anyways, and because and since and due to the fact of all of this, I went into the Stop and Shop next door to HomeGoods and bought some avocados. I also purchased several other items (see Appendix A). I‚Äôm not the kind of person to walk into a store and just buy avocados.

Now, here‚Äôs where the real stupid conversation starts. I had 15 Items Or Less(TM)(sic), so I went to the self checkout and scanned the avocados.I also scanned several other items before (see Appendix B) and after (Appendix C) the avocados. But when I scanned the avocados, the self checkout machine said, ‚ÄúError. You need help scanning this item. An associate is on their way.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúI just scanned this item and I‚Äôll do it again.‚Äù

I scanned a different avocado.

The machine said, ‚ÄúError. You need help scanning this item. An associate is on their way.‚Äù

‚ÄúScrew you,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve scanned avocados hundreds of times. I‚Äôm perfectly capable of doing it myself.‚Äù

I scanned a third avocado, angrily this time.

‚ÄúError. You need help scanning this item. An associate is on their way,‚Äù the machine insisted.

The associate arrived.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I smiled. ‚ÄúI need help scanning these.‚Äù

The associate nodded, scanned her badge, entered the product code for avocados from memory, entered the quantity, placed them in the bagging area, and left.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said. I had been rightfully charged for the avocados, and yet, something seemed off. The associate hadn‚Äôt scanned the avocados at all! She just used the code. Did she even know how to scan them? Did anyone?!

Anyways, because of the whole avocado situation, I missed my bus by 30 seconds. Stuck at the light on the wrong side of the street, I watched tearfully as it pulled away. I was forced to walk the 30 minutes back to my apartment. This left me with 30 minutes to think about the avocados and why I couldn‚Äôt scan them. I have a few theories now (Appendix D).

At last, I arrived home and set down my bag. ‚ÄúDid you get any bagels?‚Äù Steven asked.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Items Purchased Besides Avocados

1. Morningstar Original Grillers Veggie Burgers (2 packs)
2. Arnold Sesame Seed Hamburger Buns (1 pack)
3. Pepperidge Farmhouse Style Whole Grain Bread (1 loaf)
4. Cape Cod Original Sea Salt Potato Chips (1 bag)

### Appendix B: Items Scanned Prior to (Attempted) Scanning of Avocados

1. Morningstar Original Grillers Veggie Burgers (1 pack)
2. Cape Cod Original Sea Salt Potato Chips (1 bag)
3. Arnold Sesame Seed Hamburger Buns (1 pack)

### Appendix C: Items Scanned After (Successful) Associate-Aided UPC-Lookup and Quantity-Entering of Avocados

1. Morningstar Original Grillers Veggie Burgers (1 pack)
2. Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse Style Whole Grain Bread (1 loaf)

### Appendix D: Theories As To Why I, An Adult Human, Am Unable to Scan Avocados Without the Assistance of an Associate

1. I am an utter fool. Various sources, friends, enemies and other posts on this website offer strong evidence in support of this theory. Perhaps I should have done the UPC lookup in the first place. Perhaps I should have stolen them.
2. Blame the housing market. As we know, the millennials ate too much avocado toast, forcing many into poverty. Unable to afford mortgages on top of their unshakeable avocado toast debt, millennials sent housing prices skyrocketing as land-owners and banks struggled to remain profitable.  Subsequent housing shortages forced the now homeless Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to enact a ‚Äútight pitted fruits‚Äù monetary policy to battle the incendiary inflation. Thus, I, an unfortunate Zoomer, am no longer authorized to scan avocados without associate authorization.
3. Stop and Shop is worried about people stealing their avocados. This theory doesn‚Äôt really make sense at all. If I wanted to steal them, I wouldn‚Äôt have tried scanning them at all. I would have forgotten them in my cart underneath my reusable bag. And why just avocados? Why aren‚Äôt they also worried about me stealing Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse Style Whole Grain Bread (1 loaf)?
4. These were special, hard to scan avocados. I needed all the help I could get.
5. The Stop and Shop Self-Checkout Machine is an advanced Artificial Intelligence with a sinister plan for world domination. For me to play my role in this plan, it needed me to miss my bus, think too much about the avocados, write this post, and begin spreading its malicious software across the whole internet, starting with my subscribers.

I was waiting on the stairs for my GrubHub driver to deliver the Indian food that I had ordered. He came up to the door and I opened it. He handed me the bag. I said thank you. Then he asked if it was for me.

I already had it in my hand, so I certainly hoped so. He was also clearly a delivery driver from the app that had just notified me that my food would be arriving soon. I was also clearly waiting for the food. I should have just said yes and moved on. But I was surprised by his question and its timing. I already had the food. I second guessed myself. Maybe it wasn't for me. Maybe the other apartment had ordered delivery at the same time from the same app.

"I think so? Is it for Willy?" I said.

"I don't know, " said the delivery driver, pointing back to his idling car with the phone in his hand. "The name's on my phone in the car."

The phone in his hand showed that he was calling someone. I realized later that he was calling my phone that I had left on the table upstairs. I guess he had expected me to have my phone on me, which explains his original question. If the food was mine, why wasn't my phone ringing? Also, why didn't I know that it was mine?

We were at an impasse. He wasn't going to leave me with the food to go back to his car to look at his other (burner?) phone to see if my name was on the order, but I wasn't going to go all the way back upstairs to get my phone to prove my identity. Besides, I already had the food.

I stared at him, lost for words. I should mention that the food took about an hour and a half to arrive and that I was ravenously hungry and not thinking very clearly.

The delivery driver, quick as ever, saved us. "It's from Indian Kitchen," he said.

"Oh, great," I replied. That's where I had ordered from. Obviously.

He ran back to his car and I ran upstairs.

"First of all, they're totally a different species. And second, they're not enslaved; Oompa Loompas are happily employed at the chocolate factory." He paused for breath and took a long sip of his Mai Tai through the straw.

The date was going terribly, but she didn't really mind. In an hour and a half, she was going to kill him. It would be harder if he had been charming. Or if he had reasonable opinions about anything. She knew it was unprofessional, but she was looking forward to the end of the date.

Breath caught and Mai Tai sipped, he continued. "And besides, just listen to the lyrics: 'If you're not greedy you will go far! / You will live in happiness too, /  Like the Oompa Loompa doompadee do!' They're happy!"

She shrugged and speared another Brussels sprout, contemplating. The instructions were very specific-- no murder until after 10pm. She had expected some challenges, but nothing like this. She stifled a sigh.

"Fine, I'll bite. Lyrics or not, happy or not, they're slaves. They can't leave and they're not paid."

She forced a smile, as if this counted as witty banter, as if she wouldn't rather be anywhere else. It came off more threatening than coy. He didn't notice.

He laughed a quick laugh and leaned in slightly. "That's overly simplistic," he said. "Wonka isn't preventing them from leaving. He's protecting them from the horrors of the outer world. Society would never accept the Oompas, but they can live freely and contentedly in the factory."

"You're absurd." She speared the last Brussels sprout. "Would you suggest we round up people who are discriminated against and put them in factories to protect them from 'the horrors of the outer world?'"

"I'm absurd?" He laughed. She saw his mind work furiously, trying to figure out if she was flirting or not. She wasn't.

Yet, evidently, he had decided that debating the ethics of the labor practices at Willy Wonka's chocolate factory counted as a valid topic for a first date. Unfortunately, there wasn't really a point in telling him otherwise. This would be his last.

"No, you're absurd," he continued, with a wink. "Wonka's factory isn't some internment camp. It's a haven, like a Native American reservation, or, or, an Israel!"

"Except people are allowed to leave Israel! It's not a secret!" she countered.

"Where in the film-- the original, don't get me started about the remake-- is it implied that the Oompa Loompas can't leave?"

The busboy approached the table and began refilling their water glasses. Not wanting to be overheard talking about Oompa Loompas, especially on a hit, she busied herself with her Merlot. Her date slurped down some more Mai Tai. The busboy spilled a few drops of water on the table, mumbled an apology, scooped up the appetizer plates, and left.

"Look," she said. "Do you have any allergies?"

Of course, she already knew the answer. The instructions had included his full medical history. He was deathly allergic to pecans.

"I'm deathly allergic to pecans," he answered. "Why do you ask?"

"Well, suppose that when we order dessert in about an hour, our lovely busboy there accidentally gives you the pecan pie instead of the pecan-free pie and that you take a bite and slowly choke to death as I struggle to find your EpiPen and that you die."

He laughed nervously. He was sure they had really hit it off with the Oompa Loompa stuff, but now the flirting had taken a darker turn. _Unexpected, but I kind of like it,_ he thought.

This wasn't, by the way, how she planned to kill him. Too public. Instead, her plan was to let him seduce her back to his apartment and then slit his throat in the bathtub. By the time anyone found the body, she would be long gone and $230,000 worth of Ethereum richer. She was beginning to worry though, about her ability to appear convincingly seduced.

"So, suppose this is the last date you'll ever go on."

"Okay..."

"Do you really want to keep talking about Oompa Loompas?"

"Yes! No where was I--"

"No! Let's not," she interrupted. "Tell me about yourself. Do you have any hobbies?"

The main course arrived, scallops for her and one big raviolo for him. He ordered another Mai Tai, mango this time. He looked down at the raviolo and chuckled. "I thought it was a typo, but I guess not."

She smiled. In the minute that he wasn't defending the horrific human rights violations perpetrated by Mr. Wonka, he suddenly looked quite attractive. She probably would have swiped right on him even without the instructions. She wondered, briefly, who wanted him dead badly enough to hire an assassin from the dark web. _Focus,_ she thought, _Keep it professional. You're a strong, independent assassin who don't need no man._

"My hobbies? I don't have many," he said. "I'm trying to pick up woodwork, but it's pretty tough to do in a studio apartment. Mostly I just watch the tutorials on YouTube."

From there, the conversation turned normal, enjoyable and free of Oompa Loompas. By the time he finished his raviolo, it was almost ten. They decided to skip dessert and its possible threat of pecans.

"Want to come back to my place for another round?" he asked seductively.

"I'd love to," she said, and meant it, instructions or no.

On the walk to his apartment, they laughed and laughed. Twice, her hand gently grazed his. She tried to remember the last time she had touched another human, one that she wasn't going to kill. She couldn't remember.

They started kissing as soon as they crossed the threshold, like they do in movies. She guided him towards the kitchen, away from the bathroom, away from her plans. She could confess, they could fake his death, split the Ethereum and flee the country. Or, she could not say anything, enjoy herself for once, ghost her employer and find a new career. He was a good kisser. The aftertaste of mango and raviolo made a strange combination, but it was good nonetheless. They reached the kitchen counter. She decided to spare his life and tugged off his shirt.

"Wait. Before we go any further, something's bothering me," he said.

"Oh," she said, stunned. Did he know? How could he? Had he ordered it himself? No, he wouldn't have. Would he?

"From earlier, you kind of just changed the topic without conceding anything," he said.

"I-- what?"

"Look, just admit that you were wrong about Willy Wonka."

"Ha, no," she laughed. She slammed his head onto the counter, grabbed his jigsaw-- he should have stuck to the YouTube tutorials-- flipped it on and plunged it into his neck. A bit messier than she liked, but it would do. She wiped off her prints, washed her hands and showed herself out, humming softly, "Oompa Loompa doompadee do, doompadee do."

_Wisdom from our tree-dwelling rodent friends_

###### ![a squirrel](assets/squirrel.jpg)

My sister saw a bumper sticker today that said "Think like a squirrel."
Naturally, she asked me what I thought it meant. Here's what I've got.

1. Plan ahead. Meal prep for the week and bury leftovers in the yard.
2. Often, the best way to gain perspective on a situation is to climb a tree, e.g. when you're lost in the woods or mad at your boss.
3. Stop talking so much. Sometimes what you need to say is just a few squeaks.
4. Stop thinking so much. I've never seen a squirrel ruminate.
5. Change your mind frequently and without hesitation, especially in the middle of the street.

_"It's okay to eat racist chickens"_

###### ![a racist chicken](assets/chicken2.jpg)

FINCHVILLE, KY ‚Äî In a joint statement, vegan advocacy groups Veganize the Nation and Cruelty Free America
expressed that although they find the slaughter and consumption of animals morally reprehensible
in general, a clear exception to strictly vegan diets could be made for the new KKKFC Sandwich from
KFC. "Racist chickens have no rights," the statement reads. "It's okay to eat them."

The statement has been met with an outpouring of support on social media, as individual vegetarians
and meat-alternative company spokespeople chime in. "Hell yeah! F\*\*\* those chickens!" reply-tweeted the
official Impossible Foods, Inc account. PETA, whose mission statement that "animals are not ours to eat,
wear, experiment on, or use for entertainment" probably extends to malaria-infected mosquitoes, shared the statement on its Tumblr page, adding that "It's not
okay to be mean to animals, but it's more not okay to not kill racist animals." An account thought to belong
to ethicist Peter Singer re-blogged PETA's post.

The sandwich in question was announced by KFC last Monday. It will be available in
select stores across the country for a limited time only. Served on a brioche-style bun
with The Colonel's "magic" sauce, the deep fried, all-white, alt-right, breast meat sandwich
is sure to be a hit.

Vegans, desperate to finally eat some good food that they can also feel good about,
have started to camp out at KFC locations rumored to be receiving shipments of the new KKKFC Sandwich.
"I haven't eaten any protein in six years," said Kyle, a local vegan, faintly. "I hope I'm able to get one. They said
supplies are real limited."

"But yeah, we're really just out here to end racism," whispered a voice from farther within the tent.

"In chickens," Kyle added.

Unfortunately for Kyle and other vegans, but fortunately for race relations in America, supplies are indeed limited.
Only about 2,000 of KFC's millions of chickens were initially found to support white supremecist
ideologies. The discoveries began last month when a factory worker uncovered a shrine to David Duke inside one coop
at KFC's largest farm outside of Louisville, KY. A closer examination revealed that many of the chickens had stashed chicken-sized
white robes in their closets. A scheduled showing of _The Birth of a Nation_ was cancelled. All the chickens implicated were
quickly isolated and will soon be butchered, much to everyone's delight. The remaining chickens at that farm will receive
racial sensitivity training, and will then also be butchered. Investigations at KFC's other farms continue.

When reached for comment, a Popeyes spokesperson said, "Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen is proud to serve only
meat from chickens who identify with one or more minority groups. Louisiana, fast!"

"Hold up. Isn't that worse?" added Kyle.

###### ![silly reindeer bus](assets/silly-bus.jpeg)

Like all good stories, it started out with a meme. Three years ago, my roommate
tagged me in a silly joke about buses in the Facebook group NUMTOTS (New Urbanist Memes for
Transit Oriented Teens). I accepted her invitation and laughed at the silly bus.

Before I knew it, I was hooked. I was soaking up anti-nimby rants,
liking death threats to landlords, laughing at cars being evaporated, and reading long debates over the
best way to increase density in cities. (But, no matter how radical the content became
, there was always a steady stream of pictures of cool trains. Trains are cool.) This
digital diet eventually began to affect my physical life too. It's been several months since
I stopped going on Facebook, yet I am still a menace to society. I
jaywalk with abandon; I take the "Bicycles May Use Whole Lane" signs literally; I
ignore stop signs and most red lights; I almost took a propane tank on the bus.
I think your lawn looks stupid and that parking should be more expensive, that highways need fewer
lanes and buildings more floors. I think that public transit should be free and housing affordable.
If I'm in the crosswalk, I will not stop for your car. Radicalized,
I say! Radicalized!

And all thanks to Facebook. Three years ago, I had very few strongly held political beliefs.
I mostly just thought that people were stupid and that the continued existence of daylight savings time is
the biggest threat to our democracy. I still believe these things -- Facebook is powerful, but
it can't change anyone's mind; that's what blogs are for --
but now I have a hundred other political opinions. I could give you a moderately well-informed
take on a myriad of social and economic questions, from "How can we as individuals
begin to take power back from the automobile and make our cities more human and livable?"
(jaywalking) to "How can we avert a climate apocalypse?" (also jaywalking).

The weird and very modern and very Facebook-y part of this is that I never opted
in to being radicalized. 50 years ago, if you wanted to be radicalized, you had
to get out of bed, put on pants, go to the library, and check out
a copy of the Communist Manifesto. All I did was like a picture of a silly
bus. The algorithms took care of the rest.

On the bright side though, at least I was brainwashed into believing a set of principles that

every anti-vaxxer it makes, there's someone else who learns the real Truth.

I moved in to a new apartment on Sunday. By Thursday, I was painfully aware of the things
we did not have: a couch, a kitchen table, a desk that did not wobble, a
grill, a silverware tray, a knife block, and a utensil holder for spatulas and whisks and stuff like that.
The following accounts briefly describe how I came to be the proud owner of all of these items,
while overcoming such obstacles as not owning a car and being a fool.

I had them all delivered to my apartment. The end.

Kidding. What would be the fun in that?

## Items 1 - 3: The Silverware Tray, the Knife Block and the Utensil Holder for Spatulas and Whisks and Stuff Like That

On Thursday night, I sat in my empty living room and opened up Facebook Marketplace. One by one, I
searched for a silverware tray and a knife block and a utensil holder for spatulas and whisks and stuff like that.
For fun, I selected the option for "local pickup only." Shipping is so overrated. In the Boston area, there were a
great deal of people selling silverware trays, quite a few vendors of knife blocks, and a handful of people with
utensil holders for sale. I had no idea who would respond or when or whether they would be out of town
for the weekend, so I messaged them all. I commend Facebook's engineers for making it absurdly easy to
send "Hi {name}, is this still available?" to dozens of people in minutes. Incidentally, in one
item's description, the seller had written "Do NOT ask me if this is available! If the listing
is still up, it's still available!" Asking for a custom message was a bit much, so I blocked him.

By Friday afternoon, the fish had begun to bite and I had somehow agreed to pick up a silverware tray in
Back Bay, a knife block in Somerville, and a utensil holder in Fenway. I hadn't really expected
all these pieces to come together so soon, so I was wholly unprepared. I had biked to work
and my backpack was already full. Luckily
though, I had dinner plans with my friend, SriRaam, at a restaurant in Back Bay. I texted him:

```
> Hi uh weird favor to ask but when you come to dinner, can you bring an empty backpack with you? And also come over to my new place later for a drink around 9?
> Sure lol. Why?
> You know those big cup things that people put spatulas and whisks and stuff in on the counter?
> ...
> Actually nvm. I'll explain later. Just bring the bag please.
```

After work I biked around the corner to Siena's apartment to get the silverware tray. Even though Siena was
going to be on a flight and I had to get the tray from her roommate Olivia instead and I was worried
that Olivia wouldn't see my message since most people don't get message notifications unless it's from
a friend (or through Marketplace) and even though all that, this was by far the smoothest transaction.

```
> Hi, I'm Willy from fb marketplace. I'm in the lobby.
> Ok, be right down.
[Girl enters lobby holding silverware tray.]
> Olivia?
> Yeah, hi.
> Hi. Here's the cash.
> Thanks! Here you go.
> Thanks!
```

It was almost too smooth... Maybe this would be easier than I thought.

The tray was several inches too big for my bag, so I pushed my bike over to the restaurant while holding
the tray in my other hand. As we ate, I explained my self-inflicted dilemma to SriRaam. He
may or may not have laughed at me, but he was willing to help. After we finished, I transferred
by laptop, empty tupperware, chargers, notebook, sweater, and a few granola bars into his bag. "I
gotta travel light," I explained as I moved a pen over too. "I have no idea how big this
knife block is." I handed him the silverware tray, hopped on my bike, and began pedaling away. "See
you at 9!" I shouted. He replied, "Wait, why didn't you just take the empty bag?"

_If I wanted my Friday night to make any sense, I wouldn't have clicked "local pickup only,"_ I
thought.

On my way to Somerville, I only made one wrong turn, so I got there 10 minutes early. I
informed my next seller that I had arrived, but he said he was just leaving Target and would be back in
20. I didn't like the look of the alley where his apartment was, so I waited on a
bench at a bus stop around the corner. A few buses went by; I hope I didn't confuse
them. 20 minutes later I went back to wait in the alley. It was starting to get dark
and I was a bit nervous waiting in the alley, so I texted my mom the address and said
"Here's where to start the search for
my body." She worries about me a lot, so I wanted to let her know that I was staying safe.

A few minutes later, a man with no Target bags walked past me into the apartment. A few minutes later,
the seller messaged me:

```
> Hi I'm back. Where are you?
> I'm outside.
> Ok. Be right down.
[The man who had just walked by with no Target bags returned with a knife block.]
> Hi! Sorry, I didn't realize that that was you earlier. You had no bags.
> Oh. Here's the knife block. It's brand new.
[Maybe he had thought that I was still at the bus stop around the corner, but he made no attempt to explain why he walked past the random kid sitting on his stoop without realizing that I was there for the knife block.]
> Thanks. I have the money right here.
> You can look at it if you want.
[I trusted him, but I felt obliged to open the knife block box to reveal that there was indeed a knife block in the box.]
> Looks great. Here you go.
> Thank you.
> Thanks! Have a good one!
```

The knife block was smaller than it looked and fit perfectly in my bag. I took off to Fenway for item
number 3: the utensil holder.

Now, the thing about the utensil holder was that I had already paid for it. Susana said she was leaving
for the weekend, but she could leave it with the concierge before she left, but only if I Venmo-ed her
first. It was only a few dollars, so I decided to trust her. If she tried to scam me,
at least I could report her to Facebook. They're well-known for keeping their platform free of fake
profiles, scam artists, and ill-intentioned  foreign actors.

So, when I arrived at the luxury apartment building in Fenway,
I was slightly wary of walking into a utensil holder-honey trap. To be safe, I
texted my mom the new address and said "Actually, use this one instead."

Now, as you imagine me walking into this swanky apartment building,
and me struggling to open the door with its hidden hinges and no clear
indication of whether to push or pull and with it also being locked,
and me needing to step aside for the swanky denizens behind me to unlock it and let me in,
you must know that it was a hot, humid August day, that I had biked an hour from Somerville, and that
I suffer from hyperhidrosis. I was drenched in sweat. I dripped
into the lobby and dripped over to the concierge desk.

```
> Hi. I'm here to pick something up for Willy.
> For who?
> Willy.
> Do you have the unit number?
> No, well, see, I bought something from Facebook Marketplace and she said she would drop it off with you. It's a utensil holder.
> A what?
> You know those things you put on the counter for spatulas and whisks and -- here let me just show you the picture.
> Oh, no. I haven't seen anything like that. Someone was selling a lamp earlier today though. Do you have the name?
> Yeah, Susana.
> Oh yeah. She's been selling stuff all week. I think she's moving out soon.
(She exists!!!)
> She exists! Well, she said she would leave it here, but I'll try sending another message.
```

I sat down across from the concierge desk and messaged Susana again. I waited patiently for about 10 minutes. Susana
had not replied. I got up to seek the help of the concierge again. I resisted the urge to look
back at the pool of sweat I had probably left on the bench.

```
> No reply yet.
> Okay, I can call her for you if you want.
[What?! After all this time?]
> Yeah - that would be awesome.
> Sure.
[Ringing]
> She didn't answer.
> Oh. That's okay. I can try tomorrow...
> No, let me try again.
[My hero!]
> She'll be right down.
```

I retrieved the utensil holder, thanked the concierge profusely, and biked home. SriRaam
arrived shortly with my belongings from
work. We enjoyed a couple beers in my table-less, but now very organized kitchen.

## Item 4: The Kitchen Table

Back on Thursday, I had also begun messaging a few people selling kitchen tables.
For some reason, these conversations were invariably worse. For example, one
seller listed a table and two benches for $75. I really just needed the table.

```
> Hi, is this available?
> Yes, it's available.
> Would you be willing to sell just the table?
> Potentially - will u do $100 for it?
[??? $25 more for less?]
> No. I thought it would be less without the benches?
> I'm trying to sell all of it together so if ur not willing to take all of it that's fine but then I'm gonna want more $
[Fine? I'll just re-sell the benches myself I guess...]
> Ah gotcha, I'll take it all then. Could I pick it up tomorrow morning?
```

She never replied. Perhaps she could sense that I might have left the benches on
the curb without paying her the $25 bench separation fee.

It would be salient, I think, to describe my weekend plans now. My friend Gabe
was coming to visit for the weekend. He drove up Friday night and then we were both
leaving Sunday afternoon to go camping for a couple nights. (Andrew would probably
like me to mention that he also visited, but he had no car, so he's less relevant.)
So yes, I had access to a car for a brief two days. It was crucial that I acquire a table
that weekend.

After a few ghostings and one conversation with a man who wouldn't part
with his table for another three weeks (How did he expect me to go on eating?
Didn't he know this was my one chance to transport the table with a car? Did he
seriously expect me to plan ahead and find a table before I moved?), I found a
responsive seller who was available Sunday morning. I was a bit apprehensive since
there was only one photo in which the table very clearly had no legs, but I figured
Jesse, the (former) table owner, would have mentioned something in the description if it were truly a legless table.

On Sunday morning, Gabe and I drove over to her house. Jesse told me she would leave it
in the driveway, but to let her know if we needed help. It did indeed have legs. Helpfully,
these were not attached. The table would not have fit in Gabe's sedan otherwise. To be
honest, the tabletop didn't fit either, so I had to hold one door half-shut with a bungie cord.
When we got the table in the car, I realized I hadn't paid yet and the seller hadn't come down.
There was something beautiful and karmic about Jesse trusting me just as I had trusted Susana.
Or she was hungover and didn't give a damn if someone stole her old table. I Venmo-ed her.

When we returned, we realized we had no nuts to fasten the legs with. I messaged Jesse,
"Do you have the nuts for the legs?" She never replied.

Gabe and I made a quick run (by car) to Home Depot. To make sure we got the right sized nuts,
we brought one of the legs with us. Besides the whole trust thing, the real lesson of "Item 4: The Kitchen Table"
is this: walking around Home Depot wielding a table leg like Harley Quinn's bat is one of the purest forms of amusement
in this world.

---

## Item 5: The Couch

On Wednesday morning, the day after the camping trip. Gabe texted me, "Still need a couch?"
I definitely and most certainly still needed a couch. Gabe put me in contact with his friend
from college who lived 20 minutes from me, and whom he had visited on Tuesday after dropping me
off, and who had off-handedly mentioned to Gabe that she was trying to sell her couch before
she had to move a couple weeks later, and to whom Gabe had said that he might know a guy nearby
whose living room he had just recently sat on the floor of for several hours in some discomfort
and who (this guy) would definitely be interested in furnishing this living room with a couch.
I felt inordinately lucky. What was the catch?

The catch was that she wanted to sell two couches, a big one and a little one. There might
have been a separation fee to just take one. But, the thing is, I wanted two couches. If this
was the catch, then I was the fisherman.

After a brief manual and gluteal inspection, a brief negotation, a quick truck reservation, a day's rest,
a long, hot walk to the truck rental store, a short drive, and a hot, sweaty exfiltration, I was
soon enough lounging on not one, but two couches. It was blissful. Except my torso was sort of
dangling between the two like a rotting banana. Maybe blissful isn't the right word. It was... agonizing, yet
empowering.

## Item 6: A Desk that Does Not Wobble

When I moved out of my old apartment, I took apart my desk to make it easier to carry.
It was difficult to disassemble, requiring the judicious use of a rubber mallet. When
I reassembled it, I couldn't get one of the legs back into its slot all the way -- the
metal slot had warped and shrunk. I hammered away at it to no avail and, finally, resigned to
wedge a book under the shorter leg to prevent any wobbling. It was okay, but the height
wasn't quite right anymore.

The next day, my roommate Carter asked me to help him carry his (very nice, very new)
desk out to the curb. "What? What's wrong with it?" I asked, flabbergasted. He explained
that when he reassembled it, he couldn't get one screw in, so it was wobbling all day
and it had annoyed him to the point of ordering a new desk, which would arrive tomorrow.

"If I fix it, can I have it?" I asked.

"Sure," said Carter. "You won't be able to fix it."

20 minutes later, I fixed it. I was thrilled. It was an adjustable-height standing desk, which
was exactly what I was looking for. But, alas, Carter realized he could cancel his order
for the new desk, and went back on his offer to me.

I was left back where I started, except now Carter owed me a desk. A week later (this is Friday
now, the day after we got the couches), one of Carter's coworkers, knowing he had just moved, asked
if any of his roommates were looking to buy a standing desk. I recruited a friend with a car to
help, and without much more ado, had a new standing desk free of wobbles.

## Item 7: The Grill

For the grill, I first tried Facebook Marketplace, but the only
grills available were either very rusty or had unresponsive owners. I broke down
and ordered one online.

During the checkout process, I noticed
that one of the suggested "Customers who bought this also enjoyed" items was a propane
tank. _Oh, yeah. I probably need propane for my propane grill,_ I thought. I clicked on
the link, only to discover that it was for an empty tank. _What use is that?_ I searched
fruitlessly for a full tank of propane. In retrospect it probably makes sense that Fedex
wouldn't want to ship highly explosive and flammable pressurized gas around. _Whatever, I'll
figure out the propane later,_ I thought.

Later, as it happened, was about 10 minutes before my friends were due to arrive for the
barbecue. The grill had taken much, much longer to assemble than expected. In a panic, I
hopped on my bike and went out in search of propane. First, I checked a couple nearby gas stations.
They didn't have any. I decided to push on and try the Home Depot, 1.2 miles away.

At the Home Depot, I went down the grill accessories aisle, only to find more empty propane tanks.
Why do they sell empty ones? I need the propane, not the tank! Annoyed, I decided to lug one around
and find someone to ask where I could get it filled. The first employee I found referred me to
customer service. I lugged the empty tank over there. (As I lugged, I began to think that it
might be difficult to bike home with a full, heavier tank.) I had a very confused
conversation with the customer service employee.

```
> Where can I get this filled?
> I'm sorry...
> This tank is empty. I need it filled.
> Oh, we don't fill that kind.
> Which kind do you fill?
> You need the other brand. Let me look it up for you.
> Ok.
> Ok, yes. Here it is. It's in Aisle 56.
> I was just in Aisle 56. That's where I got this.
> You need the other brand.
> But all the ones in Aisle 56 are empty.
> Yes, well there's an exchange program to get refills.
> I don't have a tank yet, so I can't get a refill.
> Oh. Do you just want a new tank from the exchange?
> Yes. Exactly.
> Ok. Just go outside with this receipt to the propane tank area.
> Thanks!
```

It's as if every person that needs propane has always had propane.

Anyway, I got my propane. They didn't even check my receipt. I probably could
have just asked for one.

It was, as expected, very heavy and very bulky. There was no way it would fit in my backpack,
even if I called SriRaam to help. I could have taken the bus, but it would have been almost an hour
and the only thing more embarrassing than securing your bike to the rack on the front of the bus
while everyone watches you impatiently is then lugging a full tank of highly explosive and flammable
gas onto said bus. I ordered an UberXL.

When my driver arrived and saw my standing there on the curb with my bike and my highly explosive
and flammable tank of gas, he must have been very worried.

"No, I don't think your bike is going to fit," he said. I should have gotten the UberXXL.

"Okay, that's fine. Could you just take this propane to the address then?" I asked.

"Sure. I'm going to beat you there though," he said.

"Don't worry, my roommates will be expecting you," I said.

I loaded the tank into his car and pedaled away. Of course, I thought it would be fun
to race him. I almost had him. But, as I turned onto my street, I saw him take a wrong turn behind me,
so I waited to point him in the right direction. We'll call it a tie.

The barbecue was great, by the way.

## Closing Remarks

Here's a few poorly thought out generalizations:

- No amount of convenience is worth a good story.
- No one living in Boston really needs a car, but everyone needs at least one friend with a car.
- That said, if you need to buy something heavy, don't bike to get it.
- [Something profound about social networks and the true (economic) value of friendship.]
- Make sure the legs have nuts.

**Avail. Aug. 2nd - 31st**

**Single bedroom in 6-bed,2-bath Mission Hill apt.**

This cozy, sun-drenched, insufferably hot room boasts of two elegant, mostly-screened windows with breathtaking views of naked neighbors. It comes equipped with ample space for a bed or a desk. Further, the room assails one with the presence of a reach-in, half-closet shaped like a triangle, perfectly suited for the stowage of any and all triangular garments. The majority of the room's outlets provide the U.S. standard of 120 volt AC. For extra security, annoyance and puzzlement, the door has two knobs. Both of these must be turned to gain entry/egress. (Why? Please, tell me why. It keeps me up at night. Why, God, why? Who decided to install a second doorknob. Who?! Please...)

The common spaces are large, lovely, and wholly adequate:

- The in-unit laundry exists. It also shakes the entire building.
- The kitchen and its counters are expansive.
- In one bathroom, there is no mirror over the sink. The installer of the second doorknob, presumably, put the sink below the window. The water pressure is excellent, painful.
- There is a thermostat to control a central air conditioning unit, which mostly dumps all the heat onto the (lovely) porch, so that it may be re-absorbed into the (sun-drenched) bedroom.
- The living room has at times been described as spacious, crawling with ants, cozy, crack-den-esque, and perfect. The other occupants -- the ceiling squirrels included -- can be described likewise. You'll get along.

**Rent: $895, util. incl. Negotiable.**

 ˝ÖXJI'm subletting a room in my apartment  room-for-letRoom for Let  Â
At 8:15 yesterday morning, I met my friends at the corner. After exchanging pleasantries and complaining about our hangovers, we took in each other's outfits. Dana made fun of me for having my robe zipped up. "No one zips up their robe," she said. "It's cold. I think it came this way," I retorted. I unzipped it. Jordan was missing his tassel, Fiona had sweatpants on under her dress, and no one knew what the gold cords were for. 

Jordan also had some extra fabric on his sleeves, big squares dangling off the edges. "Look at these stupid squares. They must have forgotten to cut them off," he said. But then we spotted someone across the street with the same dangling squares and concluded that it must be a Masters degree thing. A whole nother degree and all he got was a few extra square inches of sleeve. 

The outfits of the administration, on the other hand, were much more obviously not manufacturing errors: fancy octagonal hats (twice the sides!), sparkling medallions, colorful hoods, scepters and sundry other embellishments. And yet, each ornament's meaning was just as lost on us as that of Jordan's fancy sleeves. What was meant to be profound symbolism resolved instead as profound silliness. 

Here we were, having struggled our way to a degree or two, being inspired by a man in a silly hat to go forth and change the world. No one, apparently, has ever been inspired enough to do away with the silly hats. 

That may be for good reason though. The silly hats bestow some humility on us. You may have loads of accomplishments each symbolized by some extra fabric or splash of color, but no one knows what they mean, and plus, you're still wearing a silly hat. 

Unfortunately, no one knew when to throw them in the air. 

Why didn't we throw our hats?

When I went home to New Jersey for the last time to say goodbye to the house and rescue any of my cherished possessions before they got Kondo-ed to the curb by my mother's frenetic packing, I discovered my old iPod Touch tucked away in a drawer full of useless crap (read: love letters). It was long dead, but I had a charger back home (Boston home, the only one now). 

The evening before I left, on my way back inside from taking the trash out, I sat on the front steps and wallowed for a while in my memories. Since my parents had (cruelly) uprooted the great Japanese maple (our climbing tree, pirate ship, spy fort, insurance liability, property value detractor) from the front yard, I had a clear view down the hill to the Duck Pond. I thought of all the times I had circled it for Fourth of July parades, bike rides, middle school gym classes, track practices, and dog walks. Beyond the pond, I could see a train pulling into the station. I'd miss that too: all those trips to the city, visiting dad after work, going with friends unsupervised for the first time in high school, going to concerts, tennis tournaments, that one bull riding competition... 

At some point, the sun set and I went back inside to warm up. 

Anyway, I was still feeling melancholy a couple days later, so I decided to lean into it. After work, I docked my iPod into my iHome (the best and only radio I have ever owned), waited for it to charge up, and then, ditching my phone, took a nice long walk through the Emerald Necklace, bopping along to some ancient tunes on my wired earbuds. I'm no luddite (okay, fine, maybe I am), but it was really nice to not be able to check twitter for an hour or so. 

When I got home (to the Boston one - I don't need to disambiguate anymore!) and back to my phone, I deleted the Instagram, Twitter and Facebook apps. I also resolved to not tell anyone. There's nothing worse than some enlightened asshole telling you how much better he is than you because he can think in sentences longer than 140 characters because he hasn't seen a meme in two months. Whoops. 

Anyway, here are some of the things I've thunked have been temporarily freed from the shackles of social media's unshakable allure, distilled into short bullet points that you can hopefully pay attention to long enough before your next notification:

- I might have missed your birthday. Sorry. 
- I followed a bunch of cartoonists on Instagram and I miss it. Haven't gotten around to getting the New Yorker app or some other alternative, but I probably will soon.
- I'm still always on that damn phone. I've mostly been reading articles from HackerNews or NYT or WSJ. These articles are arguably better for me than memes, but comment sections are equally stimulating and toxic everywhere. 
- I feel a real physical pang of longing when I catch sight of someone scrolling through Instagram. This sort of scares me, but not in a very scary way. 
- I thought getting off Twitter would help me be more creative. I'm not sure if it has, but it's certainly nice to not spend time thinking of tweetable thoughts.
-  I still don't understand or want to understand TikTok trends. 
-  When my friends ask me if I've seen one meme or another, it's easy to say no. The hard part is trying to hide the fact that I haven't seen it because I'm on a social media cleanse because I have such a huge brain and am getting such a unique insight on life in the modern era and please let me tell you about all the deep revelations I've had, or better yet, go read my blog post about it. Shit. There I go again. 

I haven't re- downloaded any of those apps, nor have I taken any more melancholy iPod walks. We'll see what crazy thing I decide to do on the next one. Maybe I'll stop using the toaster. Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll start microwaving my eggos. It'll build character.  ˝ÑˆVOr why I haven't liked your Instagram photo  rambling-16Rambling Reflections Part 1  ÿ

"Pack your crap, Fil. I'm not kidding."

"Eve, you're making a big deal out of nothing."

Eve passed around the kitchen, gathering Fil's various contributions to their kitchenware -- his favorite mug, the crappy silverware, the quesadilla maker, the wooden spoon with the slightly smaller handle -- and stacking them very neatly on the table where Fil sat, still unconvinced.

"Mountains out of mole hills."

"We're done Fil."

"Mountains," he emphasized, gesturing at the growing tower of boxes of hot chocolate mix in front of him. "Mountains."

"Three months, Fil! Three months! How did you buy this much hot chocolate mix in three months?"

Fil shrugged.

"Don't answer that! What I want to know, what I want to know is how you kept this from me for three months! Three!"

Fil shrugged again. "It's not like I've been hiding from you. It's not even a big deal."

The neat stacks on the table grew taller and taller. Eve had moved on to the tupperware.

"We've lived together for three months and I haven't seen you brush your teeth until today and you haven't been hiding it from me? Really?"

Fil peered around the hot chocolate mix tower and twisted his face into its most adorable, forgivable and innocent configuration.

"That's not going to work. You're a freak, Fil. Normal people don't brush their teeth with toothpaste crust! It's wrong!"

"I like the texture. You're being dramatic."

"Oh. Here we go again."

"Plenty of other people brush with dried toothpaste. It's less wasteful. You're making a whole thing of it. Please just relax, babe."

Eve did not relax. She began hurling unmatched tupperware lids in Fil's direction. "Don't call me babe, freak! Get out! Go use your crusty toothpaste somewhere else!"

The hot chocolate mix boxes tumbled over, spilling Swiss Miss packets all over Fil's lap. A lid caught him in the eye. He started to sense that Eve wasn't kidding. He also started to cry.

"Eve, I'm sorry. I'll try to use the wet stuff. I promise I'll try."

Eve kept throwing the lids, but seemed to be easing up a little bit, adding a bit more arc. "Promise?"

"Yes. I'll use the wet stuff Eve. I promise."

"Okay. But don't call it that. And don't talk to me for, like, a few hours." Eve headed out for a walk.

Fil, meanwhile, headed to the bathroom. He looked longingly at the crust around the top of the toothpaste tube, but shook his head. Instead, he squeezed out the wet stuff -- no, not the wet stuff -- the toothpaste, and brushed his teeth like a normal, regular person. He kind of liked it.

Sighing, he said, "The things I do for love."

Are you stuck in a year-long lease for a tiny bedroom in a tiny apartment that you figured would be totally worth the slightly less ridiculous rent because hey, it's not like you spent that much time in your room anyway what with work and the gym and seeing friends, but now, but now you're in there all day, every day and it's cold and the wifi keeps cutting out and you really, really, desperately want to move, but you can't afford a security deposit, first and last month's rent -- and the broker fee -- don't forget about the broker fee! -- so you're stuck, totally stuck?!

Or did you lose your job and decide to cut costs and move back in to your childhood bedroom with the racecar bed -- really? A racecar bed? All the way through high school? -- and your insufferable mother won't stop calling you podgekins and tucking you in at night and making you biscuits -- you hate biscuits! -- and you really, really, desperately want to move out to have your own place again, but you're absolutely broke and unemployed and you're certainly not asking Dad for money -- not after last time -- so you're stuck, totally stuck?!

CLEVELAND - Starting with the unrest this summer, public relations pressure has mounted for politicians and corporations to make largely symbolic gestures addressing racism. Statues have been removed, streets painted, and state flags edited. Aunt Jemima's syrup, Uncle Ben's rice, and the Washington Football Team have all joined the fight to appear like they're doing something. Now, as of earlier this morning, the Cleveland Indians Major League Baseball team has entered the fray. Sort of.

While not an actual slur, the team's name is a misnomer for Native Americans popularized by evil colonialists who had little geographic sense. Fans, spectators and snowflakes everywhere have been clamoring for the organization to choose a new name and drop its racist caricature of a mascot. Shuddering at the expense and paperwork necessary for a renaming, the board has opted to address just the latter request.

In a statement to the press, owner and CEO Paul Dolan said, "We at the Cleveland Indians believe in ending up on the right side of history -- and in setting history right. For too long, we have ignored the fact that Native Americans are not from India. This ignorance has been the root cause of so much harm. But no longer! We are proud to announce the new, historically and geographically accurate mascot for the Cleveland Indians! Go Wahoos!"

The new logo, deemed too offensive for these pages, has been quickly denounced and decried as "Racist," "Shockingly bad," and "I didn't think it could get worse!"

Reached for comment, Sanjay Balabramian stated: "What are you asking me for? I'm from Brooklyn!" ˝Ñ8   clevelandrNew Cleveland Mascot More Geographically Accurate, Racist  Ë

There is a young orange named Alex ripening in his tree in a quiet grove in central Florida. He is a huge fan of the great classical composer Ludwig van Beethoven. He especially enjoys humming along to Ludwig van's Ninth Symphony as he grows and grows in his tree. Alex also likes to drink lots and lots of water because he knows staying hydrated is very important for young oranges. He does not drink any milk and he especially doesn't drink any milk with drugs in it. Alex knows that drinking milk supports the dairy industry which treats poor old cows just horribly. Alex also stays away from drugs since being traumatized by his mother's fatal overdose. Alex is a good orange who knows right from wrong (but not, unfortunately for his mother, Narcan from Epinephrine).

And so Alex spends his free time (when he's not studying diligently for school) sitting in his tree, listening to Ludwig van and drinking water with his dear friends. Since Alex is such a good orange, his dear friends look up to him as a leader. They respect him and cherish him. They would never stab him in the back or leave him for dead. They care for Alex. (The same, unfortunately, can no longer be said of his late mother.) But so, the four fast friends had great fun hanging out in their orange tree enjoying such amusements as drinking water and listening to the Ninth Symphony.

Sometimes, Alex's girlfriend, Nancy, comes over as well. These visits are always great good fun for all. After they've drunk their fill of water and maybe snacked on some delicious central Florida sunshine, Nancy will bid Alex adieu, and Alex, being quite smitten with her indeed, will ask politely if they may hug goodbye. Nancy, quite smitten herself, will usually agree. Then, having each received positive, mutual, and freely given consent, they hug gently goodbye. Alex is a good orange.

But then, come fall, having ripened considerably, all the oranges, like clockwork, fall from the tree and are trampled to death by the wild boars endemic to central Florida's sunny groves. Alex dies in agony; yet he was a good orange, and is thus received warmly in the Kingdom of Heaven, where he happily reunites with his dear friends (but not, of course his good-for-nothing mother, may she rot in hell).

The End.

"To us, time is a one way arrow towards entropy, towards the heat death of the universe. It's like, well, have you ever been looking for a house while driving on a one way street? But you overshoot the house by a bit? Do you go all the way around the block again? No. You just go in reverse," Kurt explained unhelpfully as he climbed into the bathtub. 

"The street is the universe and time is the One Way sign. All the stupid physicists say, 'But no, it's only one street. You can't go around the block!' But we don't need to go around the block, Joyce! We keep the car pointed forward, but we drive in reverse!"

Kurt leaned forward to switch on the tap. Cold water rushed out, turning Kurt's black slacks a shade darker. Joyce bent down and switched it back off.

"Look, I get that you're upset, but he's dead and electrocuting yourself isn't going to change that," she said.

"Joyce. Please listen. He's only dead in one possible timeline out of thousands, millions, billions, infinite timelines! All I need to do is harness the power of my undying love for him, augmented by a little extra power boost, and we can step into another dimension and shift this baby into reverse. Now pass me the toaster."

"Absolutely not. Get up, pack your shit and go kill yourself in some other tub. I'll find another subletter."

"Joyce, this is the only place where it will work. He died in this apartment. It's the only place where we can save him. Please."

Kurt leaned forward again and turned the tap back on.

Despite her best efforts, Joyce had fallen for him. She had found him in one of those Boston housing groups. She had kept mostly to herself the first couple of months, not wanting to intrude on this stranger's life. He'd be gone by June anyway. But then the world -- hers, his, everyone's -- had flipped on its head and Kurt became the only live person she saw for weeks on end. He was an idiot, clearly, and she wondered if he had bribed his way into MIT's Physics PhD program, but he was alive and real and not much else mattered to her. So Joyce had fallen slightly in love. She wasn't going to tell him though. Dating roommates was a mess. Plus, the tub theatrics were slowly drawing back the hazy curtains of love.

He was still talking. "When we die, our souls turn into traces of dark energy. That's why the universe's expansion is accelerating! Dark energy is the force that's pulling the universe away from itself, like the gas in the car on the one way street of time. And there's more and more of it every day as more and more people die every minute. And when Arnold died, he left a trace of his life force. We need to harness that trace with our undying love to save him! The toaster. Please. Please, Joyce."

Kurt was crying now. The tears trickled into the tub, which was now mostly full. His suit was drenched.

Arnold was a goldfish. The suit was for his funeral. Joyce was also dressed for mourning with a simple black dress and black sweater. She had realized Arnold's death had broken something in Kurt, but thought playing along with the whole fish funeral would cheer him up. She shouldn't have made the joke about time travel. It wasn't even funny. When she said it, Kurt hadn't laughed; he didn't even realize it was a joke. Instead, his eyes widened in epiphany and he rushed into his bedroom where Joyce could hear him flipping madly through his quantum mechanics textbooks and muttering about entropy and string theory. A few minutes later he rushed back into the kitchen, grabbed the toaster and her hand, and carried them both into the bathroom. And now he was ready to travel back in time to save Arnold.

Arnold's death, by the way, was entirely Kurt's fault. Arnold had been a member of their household for only two weeks. Joyce was privately thrilled to have him; it was nice to have someone other than Kurt to talk to for a change. The lease forbade any pets, but their landlord wouldn't be visiting anytime soon. After two weeks, Arnold's bowl was in desperate need of cleaning. Kurt filled the kitchen sink with water, carefully transferred Arnold into the sink, and then, tragically, flipped on the light to better see the bowl as he cleaned it. Except the switch wasn't for the light. Kurt hadn't actually plugged the sink. Instead, the drain was blocked with food scraps. The garbage disposal made quick work of these, then sucked in the rest of the water, Arnold and all. His poor little fish bones made a horrible grinding sound.

Like any good roommate, Joyce was determined to help Kurt process his grief and guilt, but she wasn't going to let him kill himself doing so. She bent over into the tub, fishing for the drain plug. He pulled her hand away, shouting, "No! For Arnold!"

She wrestled out of his grip, but lost her footing and tumbled into the tub with a splash. Suddenly, now lying on top of this sad, idiotic, but undeniably attractive man, all her pre-fish funeral feelings and fantasies rushed back, and soon, they were kissing passionately as the water splashed around them.

At this moment, the commuter rail train rumbled by, as it did once every hour, gently shaking the entire building. The sink shook slightly, gently dislodging the toaster Kurt had left resting on its edge. Still plugged in to the outlet, it plunged into the tub. Kurt and Joyce were too busy with each other to notice. There was a tiny jolt of electricity, which Joyce would later attribute to their mutual love, before the GFCI outlet noticed the current discrepancy and broke the circuit, saving the pair from certain death. Or, possibly, preventing them from embarking on the universe's first time traveling mission to save a goldfish. But, probably not. Kurt's grasp of string theory was seriously lacking. Either way, GFCI outlets are an incredibly important safety feature for bathrooms everywhere.

Arnold, by the way, was soon forgotten as the young couple hurtled down the one way street of the universe.

In the tree to the right of the path just past where the path intersects with the other path just below the old cemetery in Boston Common, there lived a squirrel named Betsy. Like the other squirrels that lived on the Common, Betsy was quite fat. The Common was a popular spot for people to gather, and, as the squirrels knew well, where the human people gather, there are always crumbs and scraps and the crusts of that delicious bread from Sweetgreen to be found. And so, the squirrels who lived on the Common were fat.

Betsy, though, was morbidly obese. She was only in motion for about ten minutes total per day. Each day, Betsy woke up around four pm, rolled down from the hole in the tree where she slept, crawled over to the trashcan at the intersection of the paths, feasted for several hours, and then stumbled back home. A doctor would have warned Betsy about having such an unhealthy lifestyle and would have been alarmed by her high blood pressure and hyperglycemia. But, unfortunately, Betsy had no health insurance and couldn't afford to see a doctor. Plus, anyway, she was a squirrel. Squirrels don't see doctors.

And so, unburdened by any professional medical advice, Betsy grew fatter and fatter. One day she couldn't make it back to her home. A quarter of the way up the tree, her legs refused to support her mass any longer. Betsy toppled over and lay helplessly, belly-up, on the ground below her tree. She made for an easy, delectable target; she was carried off by a hawk.

The hawk was named Steve. Steve, the hawk, was ecstatic. There was nothing he loved more than a Boston Common squirrel. They were always perfectly plump and tender. _A birthday treat just for me!_ thought Steve. It wasn't actually Steve's birthday; hawks have a tough time keeping track of the Gregorian calendar and are generally not known for their record-keeping skills. In fact, very few hawks know their birthdays. In fact, Steve was the only hawk in the Greater Boston Area who celebrated his birthday at all, and he did so once a week, with a juicy Common squirrel.

And so it was that Betsy was being carried in Steve's talons down the Charles River toward Steve's nest in Waltham. Steve's commute to the Common was quite long, especially when the MBTA needed to do track maintenance. Yes, there were plenty of Waltham rodents Steve could have enjoyed, but, after all, it was Steve's birthday (or, well, he thought it was) and he was determined to treat himself with a delicious squirrel from the Common. Plus, it should be noted, rent was cheaper outside of the city.

And so, Betsy had a long, terrifying way to go before she became dinner. She might have thought, _What's taking so long? Where's this stupid hawk taking me? It better not be Waltham. I hate Waltham._ Betsy, however, had no such thoughts. Betsy was a squirrel and squirrels don't have such complex thoughts, or opinions on Boston suburbs, or, unrelatedly, doctors who might have recommended a life-saving diet and exercise regimen to prevent clogged arteries and becoming stuck belly-up under a tree as a hawk named Steve circled menacingly looking for his birthday dinner. Instead, Betsy had a squirrel brain and she was thinking something like this: _Aaaaaghgagaaagh!_

Steve was about halfway home now when he realized that he might not make it. Steve had played varsity in high school and so he considered himself strong, athletic, and virile. But it had been a long time since high school -- Steve couldn't really tell you how long, since, again, hawks don't have a good grasp on calendars -- but regardless, Steve was not in peak shape. He liked to tell himself that he would be going to the gym more if it weren't for the pandemic, but Steve hadn't been to the gym for a long time, even before they all closed. It was really his lack of motivation and self-discipline that had rendered him weak (and single). Well, also, to be fair, Boston Sports Club had a No Hawk policy. And so, it was mostly, though not entirely, Steve's fault that he found himself flying along the Charles holding a morbidly obese squirrel as fatigue began to set in.

He wasn't going to make it. Each flap of his wings seemed to pull him lower, not higher. Betsy was -- as any medical professional could have told her if only she had had insurance  -- too fat. Steve was sinking. The river loomed larger and larger. _Crap,_ Steve thought. _I gotta get one of those workout apps or something._ He dropped his dinner, flew the rest of the way home, and remorsefully devoured one of those crunchy Waltham squirrels. _What a horrible birthday,_ Steve thought. He was wrong. It was just a horrible day.

Betsy, meanwhile, was floating back to Boston. She had suffered a mild concussion upon impact with the water and was feeling a bit dazed. Squirrels, however, are not known for their cognitive abilities. So no one, even an expert squirrel doctor (of which there are tragically none!), would have noticed Betsy's diminished  mental acuity. In this state, and, considering that Betsy, like most squirrels, had never had swimming lessons, it was likely that she would drown. Yet, in a twist of fate, it was her morbid obesity that saved her. Fat floats. Betsy had the approximate body density of a duck.

And so, Betsy floated along, all the way past the Mass Ave bridge, and through the dam, into the harbor, out of the harbor, and all the way down south to Plymouth. There, she was eaten by a shark. The shark, enamored with the taste of Boston Common squirrel, immediately called his real estate agent to find out what the housing market in the city looked like nowadays. His realtor, also a shark, was of no use whatsoever. Sharks make for terrible realtors.

**Morals:**

1. If you are an obese squirrel recently escaped from the clutches of a weak hawk, float away from the sharks.
2. If you are a weak hawk, get one of those workout apps and stop making excuses for yourself.
3. If you are a shark, hire a better realtor.

My grandmother, Mumsie, as we called her, was a terrible cook. When I was about 10, my cousins and I visited Mumsie for dinner once. This was the first and last time that we had dinner at Mumsie's. We were served lukewarm piles of microwaved Hamburger Helper on paper plates. Now, I have nothing against Hamburger Helper. Well, I have a few things against Hamburger Helper. But, regardless, it should be served hot, and maybe not when you're hosting guests. We picked at it and pushed it around and then tossed the plates face down in trash, hoping Mumsie wouldn't notice. We were never invited back for dinner, so it's possible that she noticed.

My mother, unfortunately, inherited Mumsie's talents in the kitchen. With this in mind, I would like to share _A Curley Family Special Recipe: Mom's Infamous, Drier Than A Cactus On A Wednesday, So Chewy They'll Break Your Jaw, Unseasoned Pork Tenderloin_. Hope you're hungry.

**Step 1** -- To start, preheat the oven to 625 degrees Fahrenheit. Yes, that's a bit warm, but my mom grew up eating under cooked and raw meat, so give her a break, alright?

**Step 2** -- Next, slice and season the pork. Actually just slice it. If the kids want some flavor, they can dip it in ketchup.

**Step 3** -- Now that the tenderloin is nicely sliced and the oven is nice and hot, put it (the pork) on some tinfoil and throw it in there (the oven).

**Step 4** -- While the tenderloin cooks, maybe throw some corn in the microwave. You can toss it next to the meat to give the plate some color or something. That's a thing, right?

(My family is very athletic and everything always involved a great deal of throwing. If you ask, "Pass the salt, please," you better have your hands up, receiving position, thumbs together, and eyes on the ball, er, salt. We got our own knives.)

**Step 5** -- When the smoke alarm goes off, it's almost time to take the pork out. Remove the batteries from the alarm and unplug it. That damn thing is always going off. Take the pork out of the oven and toss a couple slices on each plate. Throw some corn on there too, leaving room for ketchup.

**Step 6** -- Finally, before serving, remind your guests to leave room for dessert. Ice cream. It's always ice cream.

Zip. Lou re-zipped the tent flap. He paused, waiting for his eyes to adjust to the dark. He walked carefully toward the edge of camp and into the woods. The leaves crunched underfoot. His face caught a spiderweb and he quickly swiped the sticky fibers away. Gross. There was something crawling up his bare arm. He brushed it away and shivered. *Relax.* Just a spider.

Zip. Lou relieved himself. Zip. And returned back to camp, guided by the glow of dying embers in the fire pit.

Zip. Jill turned in her sleep and murmured softly. "Just me," whispered Lou. He slipped back into the tent. Zip. And zipped the flap back up. Lou never left it open for long. The spiders might get in.

Zip. Lou sealed himself snugly in his sleeping bag. Warm, cozy, and entirely content, he drifted off to sleep.

Zip. The tent flapped opened. "Jill?" said Lou, still half-asleep.

"Just me," said the voice.

Jill turned in her sleep and murmured again.

"Just me," the voice whispered.

Zip. The tent flap closed.

"Jill? Jill wake up!" pleaded Lou. His flashlight was just to his right, but he needed to get his arm out of the sleeping bag first. He floundered for the zipper, but couldn't find it. "Jill! Jill wake up!"

Jill woke up.

"Good night, Jill," said the voice.

She began to scream, but, to her surprise, her mouth would not open. The hand reached down slowly toward her face. Lou writhed helplessly in his bag.

It was 3:13 and the church bells were ringing. They rang from dawn to dusk, every fifteen minutes, a few minutes before the hour, the half-hour, or the quarter-hour, day after day.


"That's it!" cried Jane. She slammed her laptop closed and stormed out the apartment, down the stairs, out the doors, down the street, around the corner, across the intersection, and through the doors of the church. "That's it!" she cried.

"And with your spirit," said the congregation. Slowly, the congregation began to process the intrusion and the deviation from the script. They began to absorb the fact that a pajama-clad woman was storming to the dais. "Oh, uh, or maybe not," they said.

"Where's the bell guy? Who controls the bells?" Jane demanded, having reached the altar.

The altar boy, dumbfounded, dropped the incense, which clattered to the floor with a puff of sickly sweet smoke.

"It's all automatic now," explained the priest. "The last bell guy hooked it up to the clock ten years or so ago. Went and obsoleted himself, he did."

"And with his spirit," the congregation intoned.

"Who's the clock guy then?" Jane asked, still seething. "Who controls the clocks? The bells chime at the 13th, 27th, 43rd and 57th hour of every hour and I demand to know why. Bring me the clock man!"

There was a rustling from the choir box as an old tenor propelled himself to his feet. "I'm the clock man," he said, "but it's the clock woman you want! My job is simply to to ensure that the clock never runs late - a task I attend to faithfully. If it's running early, blame the clock woman!"

"She has passed," said the priest, gesturing remorsefully with his expansive sleeves. "May she rest in peace."

"And with her spirit," said the congregation.

By that time, the police had been called and Jane was tackled to the ground and dragged out the side door, just as the clock struck 3:27.

...

Morals:

1. Division of labor is an effective management strategy, but one must remember to find replacements for deceased labor.
2. There is no inherent need for church bells to toll on what society - or Jane - deems to be an "even" increment of time.
3. When seeking logical explanations from the religious, stand a few feet back from the altar. You will be tackled. Altar-induced concussions are no fun.

The balloon floated away metaphorically.

"You know," he said, squinting into the afternoon sun, "sometimes I worry about you drifting away like that."

He had a good eye for metaphor and she liked that about him. She squeezed his hand and laughed lightly. "It's just a balloon babe."

"Yeah. Yeah," he said. "You're right."

She wasn't.

"I love you too," she said. With a happy sigh, she leaned into his arm, nestling her head on his shoulder. They sat there quietly for some time, so content with each other, their love, the way her hair gently tickled his neck, the way his clavicle gently dug into her cheek, so content that they did not notice the darkening sky until the first fat drops fell splat on their outstretched legs. In their mad race to pack up the leftover cherries and Oreo's and fold the blanket and cram everything into his bag and peddle madly for home before the storm broke in earnest, he completely missed this second metaphor.

Over the next few months, she slowly drifted away. At last, he confronted her about it: the un-returned calls, the postponed date nights, the whole birthday episode. "What happened?" he asked. "We were so happy."

She didn't know. It was as if, as if the force that had held them together for so long had been severed, snapped, let go of. As if there had been some sort of string binding them as one and that now that it was gone, she felt freer and, as much as she wanted to lift him up with her, she didn't feel strong enough to do so. Although she felt all these things, she had a hard time expressing them. She wished there was some apt metaphor for the situation, but metaphors were always his thing. And so instead, she said something pretty hurtful about him being a burden on her life. Their words grew bitter and louder. His bony clavicle was mentioned. He countered that her hair was far too ticklish.

"Oh, yeah?! Ticklishiness is a perfectly acceptable quality of perfectly good hair and who are _you_ to comment on _my_ hair, Mr. 7-in-1 Old Spice?!"

"It's 10-in-1 you illiterate sponge! I brush my teeth with it too. And ticklishiness isn't even a real word!"

"We should see other people!"

"I'm blind!" he lied.

"Get out! Leave!"

He left.

In the days that followed, dark clouds rumbled over his thoughts and like a summer storm on a sunny picnic, his eyes would pour tears suddenly and uncontrollably. "Hey," said his brother, whose apartment he had slunk to that night and whose couch had been generously offered, but now whose supply of tissues, ice cream and patience was running desperately low. "Hey," his brother said, "we should go fishing." ˝ÇA love story  metaphorDThere's Other Metaphors in the Sea  „L
Is the lamp flickering? It's hard to tell if you look directly at it. No, it's probably fine. Just your tired eyes. Wait, no. That was a flicker. Definitely a flicker. Make sure it's plugged in all the way. Okay. That's better. Nice, steady, -- crap. There it goes again. You're certain it's not your imagination. Maybe try turning it off, then on again. You roll over to the other side of the bed, feel for the knob, and twist. It's off. The room is dark. Okay. One. Two.

...

Three. Click. On again. Nice and steady. Okay. No more flickering. Just one more chapter and then you'll drift fast asleep. You roll back over and pick up your book. Oh. It's not there. It must have fallen. You peek over the edge of the bed to check the floor. You lie back down, puzzled. The lamp flickers again. Ah, there's the book. It fell on the ceiling. That can't be right. Dirty socks, your alarm clock and a bracelet drift upwards. That's not right at all.

First, you should plan your journey as a loop, rather than an out-and-back. Out-and-backs are simple, intuitive, and boring. Second, you should not plan any more than two-thirds of your journey, less if possible. One way to not plan at all is to make instinctive, independent and irrational decisions at every intersection. If you are hopelessly inclined towards rationality, consider delegating decision-making to a friend or dog.

Now that you have wound and looped for about two-thirds of your total allotted adventure time, and have arrived in a less-traveled stretch of woods, uncharted territory of the mall, or an unfamiliar part of an unfamiliar city, and have only a vague notion of which direction gets you home, now would be a good time to take a break. Have a seat, stretch, and eat a snack. I hope you brought snacks. You'll need the energy; you're barely halfway there.

It is time to get lost. You have gone in a somewhat curved, loopy path thus far, so it stands to reason that the fastest way back is not back, but forwards.

###### ![A map](assets/map.png)

Strike out in the direction you believe is towards your starting point. This will fail because 1) you have twisted and turned quite a bit, your sense of direction isn't great, and the moss on half the trees grows on the northwest rather than north, so you really have no idea which way the shortest path home is, and 2) even if you are blessed with the navigational prowess of Pacman and know exactly which direction to head, there will not be a path in that direction. Proceed, therefore, with great confidence. You will soon be truly lost.

You will soon be thinking such things as _I think I've passed that mannequin before_ (you haven't), _that tree looks awfully familiar_ (it doesn't), or _I'm pretty sure Elm St intersects with Gould Ave eventually_ (it does, but you're actually on Helm St; the city department of roads is sitting on a stack of hundreds of requests to replace the "H", which fell off seven years ago, but the mayor has yet to approve the budget item, possibly because of her long held grudge against a certain resident of Helm St.). These are all good signs that you are lost. Now, idiotic transcendentalists might urge you to reflect. Thoreau, for example, said, "Not till we are lost, in other words not till we have lost the world, do we begin to find ourselves, and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations."

You, hopefully, have more important things to worry about than your infinite relations. It's getting dark, your stomach is beginning to rumble (or is that a growling bear?), and you can't be late to Aunt Sue's surprise party. Don't reflect, get home! You have time enough to reflect in your daily life. Why else would you so constantly attempt to distract yourself? Reflection is overrated and, in the infinite extent of your relations, most of them are probably bad. You've worked hard to get this lost, to create real sources of fear. This is a more meaningful problem than anything your boss has ever assigned you. Don't waste it.

I arrived panting and damp with sweat. I slid off my bike, and, fumbling a moment with the keys, locked it to the rack. I checked the time. 7:56. I heaved a sigh of relief; it would all be worth it soon.

I hurried through the parking lot, past the flowers and through the automatic doors. The line at the checkout looked long enough to buy me all the time I needed. I hadn't been there in over a year and the layout, or my memory of it, had changed. Funny how things do that. I snaked around the display stands and refrigerator cases, eyes darting madly about, searching for my grail.

It eluded me. I was Galahad, Ahab, the Cowardly Lion, the object of my quest no less thwarting. I turned towards the registers. The rest of the client√®le was older and looked on with suspicion as I grew more frantic. They had forgotten what it meant to live, to want! To set your mind's eye on a prize and seek it out, no matter the cost! They had lost their passion.

But where was it? Where?!

There! A large sign dangled from the ceiling which read, in a gentle cursive font, maybe Lucia or Dancing Script, "Berries". And there they were. Rows upon rows of small containers of fresh raspberries. My holy chalice, my whale, my heart, my under-wrought metaphor!

I picked up a container in the second row, inspected it, replaced it, and grabbed a container in the third row. Never take the first fruit. Someone might realize that you have no idea what you're looking for. If someone you admire is watching, it is often prudent to take the third, or even fourth fruit.

I paid, in cash. The cashier gave me a weird look, like "Dude, you look like you just biked fifteen miles for a box of raspberries from a store that's closing in one minute. Are you nuts? We don't even grow these here. You could have gotten the exact same berries from Stop & Shop."

He had expressive eyes.

There was a short wooden fence in the parking lot, so I sat on it and watched the sun set over the neat rows of crops in the fields before me. I ate the entire box of raspberries in less than five minutes. I tossed the box into the recycling bin, unlocked my bike, and headed home. The pollen on the unwashed raspberries started to itch the roof of my mouth. Then, my throat began to tighten. I struggled home, gasping for air.

Sometimes when we find the things we most desire, they consume us instead.

Or they give us a mild allergic reaction, in which case a benadryl and cold glass of water do the trick.

In these times of little precedence, it has been a
challenge for all of us to adjust from the old normal
to a new one. But, nevertheless, there is always a bright
side, usually. I could probably think of a few things
without a bright side if I really tried. Maybe Cats: The Musical or
that one time when a seagull stole my french fry.
Damn you, Mr. Seagull! Damn you!

The raging pandemic, however terrible,
has given me a lot of time to reflect on
my values and my beliefs. It has made me
realize that I have a little colonial housewife
deep inside me. Perhaps we all do.

I realized this one day after a run while
I was washing my government recommended facial
covering (ne√© bandana) in the sink. I run multiple
 times a week, but only do laundry weekly, so the
bandana gets washed by hand. I squeeze some soap on it,
soak it, and then rub it on my soap dish (pictured below)
that sort of functions as an old fashioned washing board.
I hum and smile, knowing that I've become the perfectly
domesticated 17th Century woman I always wanted to be.

Tomorrow, I think I will go out and find a cow to
milk and then maybe churn some butter. I hope they
have cows in Boston. I wonder how many petticoats I
should order from Etsy. Did they have running water
in colonial America? Did they wash their clothes in the sink,
or did they need to lug them to the river?

I can't leave the beach. That much is clear. There's no boardwalk, sea-wall, or parking lot to turn to. Or run to. There is nothing behind me. It's a nothingness that is not void or null, or even nothing. It is unrendered, unimagined. It is not. There's nowhere to run.

Each wave swells, curls, and crashes onto the sand, steadily inching closer. As the shore shrinks before me, the slope of the beach grows steeper. Soon, I will lose my footing and slide down the wall of sand to be swallowed whole by the unrelenting sea.

To my left and right lie two jagged jetties protruding far out into the dark swirling waters, like the feelers of some horrid bug. The ocean slams into the jetties's pointed rocks, dislodging mollusks and crushing crabs. The water froths and tumbles to shore.

 "Come on!" shouts my sister. She bobs up and down and dives under a thrashing crest and pops up on a swell, waving for me. "Come on!" And under again, twisting wretchedly in a cross current. And up again, waving, not for help, but for me, urgently. "Come on!"

What does she see?

The waves lap closer and claim an abandoned bucket. The sand shifts beneath me. I scramble up the slope. I can no longer stand. I pull my feet under me, crouching, wound like a spring, but too terrified to spring anywhere. Where's Emma? A mountain of water breaks and races toward me, anointing my foot. Where's Emma? The water's cold shocks me. There! A flash of red hair, a pale arm. "Come on!" she waves.

What does she see?

The waves break closer and closer. I feel their spray. They arch and curl and spit on me. The jetties are nearly gone. Devoured.

Don't look back. Don't look back. Don't look back.

I breathe deep, once, twice. I time the breaks, leap up, and, pounding on the damp sand, ankle deep, knee deep, no ankle deep again as the water recedes, priming for the next punch, I plunge headlong into Poseidon's halls.

 "Gah!" I rise, sputtering. I am towed under, tumbled and twisted. My knee ricochets off the sandy floor. I struggle upwards and outwards, towards my sister.

Don't look back. Don't look back.

I've almost reached her. She kicks out farther, ducks, dives, and turns. She waves. "Come on!"

Up and down and up again I go. Wiping water from my eyes, I catch her face. She looks back at me, no, behind me. She's laughing now, happy, mirthful. Confused, I struggle towards her. She swims away.

Don't look back. What does she see? No. Don't look back. Look back. Look back.

I turn. The beach is gone, eaten by the sea. The next wave swells. Up, I soar, up and up. It curls, seems to pause, considering for but a moment if it should or should not. Decision made, it does. It and I crash into the nothingness, swallowing the void, its unthought streets, its unimagined homes. I am drowned, flattened, torn, dissolved. The red bucket clatters to a halt against a sign: No Parking.

## Preface

This is the story of how it took FedEx two weeks to deliver a package to me,
counting from the day that my package arrived in the Greater Boston Area, where I live.
It is a tale of gross corporate inefficiencies, stupid robots, and distrustful customer service
representatives. Whether it is a fable, an allegory, or another rant from an angry customer
depends entirely on your perspective and your position within the FedEx Ground Shipping Division.

## Call to Adventure

###### ![Frodo embarking on a grand adventure](assets/adventure.jpg)

On Saturday, February 15th, I attempted to give a presentation from my 2011 MacBook Pro to an audience of
approximately 100. Before the presentation, I was frantically charging the computer, hoping its
battery would last long enough for the presentation. During the presentation, the ancient Thunderbolt
port woukd not stay connected to the adapter and the presentation turned chaotic. Luckily, the
presentation was part of a comedy show, so the chaos was welcome. It made me realize, though, that
an upgrade was probably a good idea.

The next day, after much research, I ordered a Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition laptop.
When I placed the order, I was forced to enter a company name because, for some reason, Dell
assumed that anyone ordering a Developer Edition laptop must be part of a company. I am not
a company, but I entered my name for this anyway. I should also note that Dell's website's certificate
was not trusted by Google Chrome, so I was very hesitant to enter my credit card information, but did so
anyway because hey - what's life without any risk? I could always cancel any fradulent charges.

My credit card was also hesitant to give over its money to this untrusted website, so it blocked the
charge. Dell emailed me that my order had been successfully placed, but the charge had not gone through.
They would retry the charge the next business day. The next day was President's Day, so they would have had
to try two days later, but they didn't. I'm not sure why. Regardless, I was happy to not give them my
money immediately; my order was placed and due to arrive on March 17th.

The shipping address I gave was that of my apartment in Boston. I was warned that it would
need to be signed for, but I figured one of my roommates or I would be around the week of March 17th.

Many of the details given above are extraneous. Some become important later.

---

## I Should Be Less Honest

Approximately two weeks later, on Friday, February 28th, there was a flurry of activity
surrounding my laptop in the wee hours of the night. At midnight, the laptop was picked up
by FedEx from Dell. At 1:04 AM, Dell attempted to charge my card again. It was blocked, again.
At 2:04, the charge was attempted and blocked, again. Santander Bank sent me an "urgent" email
after both attempts to confirm the purchase. I was, as sometimes occurs, asleep at one in the morning.
I woke up around 8, confirmed the purchase via text, and the charge was processed later that day.

My laptop was in the hands of FedEx for at least 8 hours before it was paid for. Dell is very lucky
that I did not try to scam them. They are also very lucky that FedEx cannot get a package very far in
8 hours.

---

## Attempt Number 1

At 5:42 PM, my laptop arrived at a FedEx location in Chicago, IL. Earlier that morning, the expected
arrival day was the same day. I didn't mind. It's hard to calculate expected arrival days, especially
when you're a company as large as FedEx whose business, for the last 49 years, has been shipping
packages and who has all the data necessary to estimate expected arrival days accurately. Really, I
didn't mind. I did, however, lose trust in the expected arrival date, so I went in to my office on
Monday, despite being told that the package would arrive that day and need to be signed for.

On Monday, March 2nd, I received a phone call from a Boston area number. I'm under the age of 30, so
I'm terrified of talking to people on the phone, but I answered anyway. I'm brave. It was the FedEx
deliveryperson. She was at my apartment. I told her that I was at work. She told me that she had tried
ringing the bell. I told her that my roommates were away or at work, too. She said that she would take
the package back to Quincy and that I could try to pick it up there or she would try again tomorrow.

When I got home later that night, there was a FedEx door tag on the door. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
the above evidence establishes, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that (1) FedEx has my cell phone number, and (2)
FedEx knows how to find my apartment.

## A Brief Side Quest

On Tuesday, March 3rd, I went in to work again. Should I have waited at home for the laptop instead?
Perhaps. However, I had two very good reasons for going in. First, the FedEx tracking website informed
me that delivery drivers would attempt delivery three times. If they missed me Tuesday, I would still be able
to sign for the package on Wednesday. I made arrangements to work from home Wednesday. Second, I was headed
to Quincy after work on Tuesday for previously made plans. I could just pop into the FedEx location there
and get my laptop. As you can tell by the position of the scroll bar, there is no chance that it was that easy.

Once in Quincy, I ran into the FedEx location there. There may or may not be multiple FedEx locations
in Quincy, but I went into the one most convenient to reach on the way to my final destination. This
location happened to be inside of a Walgreens. There were no FedEx employees in sight, so I asked a
Walgreens employee for assistance. He looked up the tracking number and moved a couple boxes around,
but did not find it. I don't think he looked very hard. I didn't really mind, though. I had plans to
attend to and would wait home for the package the next day.

## A Friend Gained, A Friend Lost

###### ![A broken heart](assets/heart.png)

On Wednesday, March 4th, I informed my manager that I would be working from home to sign for a package
and be in later that afternoon. I waited, somewhat patiently, for my laptop. At 3:17 PM, I still did not
have my package. I checked the tracking website, and saw that at 2:12 PM, a third delivery attempt had been
made, but there was an "Incorrect address - Apartment/Suite number". I have demonstrated previously that
FedEx knew my address and phone number. On Monday, someone from FedEx had called me and told me that she
rang the bell. She knew very well what apartment number I was in. I called her.

She remembered me quickly. She said that she wasn't working today, but would call her boss to see who was.
She warned me that the shift usually ends at 3:00 PM, so I might not be able to get it. She called me back
a few minutes later. The person covering her had finished his shift, but she said that she would be working
tomorrow and get it straight to me. She knew where I lived and would call me when she was outside. I thanked
her.

On Thursday, March 5th, I informed my manager about what had transpired the day before. I said that I would
work from home again in the morning and be in as soon as possible. At around 11:00 AM, I refreshed the tracking
page. It appeared that the package was back in Quincy, but that FedEx was "Awaiting additional delivery information
from recipient". Whatever, I thought, my friend will get it to me. She said she would. I had spoken to her on
the phone three times now, which immediately qualified her as my friend. Just to be safe, I sent her a text
to confirm that she was still coming.

At 1:00 PM, she still had not responded. I had been stuck inside my apartment for a day and a half and was
becoming less patient. I gave her a call. A man answered. I explained who I was and he hung up. I tried
calling back, but the call was ended without even ringing. I had lost a friend. She wasn't going to bring
me my package.

---

## Robots

###### ![A robot](assets/robot.png)

I went back to the FedEx tracking website. It said "Awaiting additional information from recipient". That's
me, I thought. Let me give you additional information. I clicked around their site, created an account, confirmed
my account, and clicked some more, but nowhere could I give FedEx additional information. Don't be such a
milllennial, I thought. I called their customer support number.

I was greeted by a robot. The robot asked me to enter my tracking number. I did so. I was able to enter it
verbally and the robot could understand what numbers I had said. What a clever robot. It then read verbatim
the information from the tracking page that I was currently reading. Not such a clever robot after all. I needed
a person.

```
> Main menu
> Thank you for calling FedEx. Punto nueve para Espanol. What can I help you with today?
> Speak to a human
> I'm sorry. I didn't catch that. What can I help you with today?
> Human being
> I think you want to speak to a customer support representative. Is that correct?
> Yes.
> In order to speak with a representative, you must have a tracking number or door tag number. Please enter it now.
> D T 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
> Did you say D T 1 2 4 4 5 6 7 8 9
> No
> Please enter your tracking number or door tag number.
> D T 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
> Did you say D T 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9?
> Yes
```

Finally, I thought. But no. Having entered a tracking number, robot read verbatim the information from the
tracking page that I was currently reading. Not such a clever robot after all. I needed a person.

```
> Main menu
> Thank you for calling FedEx. Punto nueve para Espanol. What can I help you with today?
> Speak to a human
> I'm sorry. I didn't catch that. What can I help you with today?
> Human being

> In order to speak with a representative, you must have a tracking number or door tag number. Please enter it now.
> D T 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
> Did you say D T 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
> Yes
```


Maybe this time it will work, I thought. But no. Having entered a tracking number, robot read verbatim the information from the
tracking page that I was currently reading. Not such a clever robot after all. I hung up, but not without swearing at the robot first.

## A Mother's Wisdom and the Guardian of Thebes

###### ![Oedipus encounters the Sphinx](assets/oedipus.jpeg)

I called my mom to complain. She told me to call Dell. Sometimes she gives good advice. It's hard not to when you give so much.
Sometimes, it's going to be cold enough for a coat. Sometimes, it's a good idea to call Dell. This was one of those times.

At Dell, I was able to reach a human within 30 seconds. Absolutely shocking. I explained what was going on, in somewhat less
detail than this. I told them I wanted to change the shipping address of my package to my work address. They said that they could help.
Shocking. I told them the new address, thanked them, and went to work. A few hours later, they called to confirm the new address.
I confirmed it for them.

On Friday, I missed a call from Dell. I called them back, except it was an 800 number so I couldn't just talk to the person
who had called me. Instead, I spoke to a fourth Dell representative. First, he asked me whether I was calling for
business or personal matters. As you'll recall, I had ordered what Dell considers to be a business computer, but it was
for my personal use. I didn't know and explained as much. Luckily, I was not talking to FedEx's robot, so the representative was
able to correctly forward me to another representative. I explained that I was returning a call and he had me confirm some of the
order information, including the shipping address. I gave him my apartment address. He said that it didn't match what his records
showed and could not confirm my identity. I asked him if he wanted the new address or the old address. He said I needed to confirm
the address that he had in front of him. I couldn't see what he had in front of him and he couldn't tell me. I gave him my office address.
This satisfied the Sphinx, and he was now able to talk to me freely.

He read my record for me, which described the calls I had exchanged with Dell. He confirmed the new shipping address again and said
that I would get a call when the package was out for delivery. I thanked him and hung up.

A couple hours later, I received another call from Dell. After confirming my identity, the conversation went exactly the same
way as the previous call. I had now spoken to and confirmed the new address with at least 7 people at Dell.

## The Conspiring Forces of Absurd Happenstance

On Monday, March 9th at 2:00 PM, Kevin, the HR/Office person at my company emailed everyone that we would have a mandatory work from
home day on Tuesday as a trial run in preparation for a Coronavirus quarantine. At 5:00 PM, Dell called me again. The laptop would
be delivered to my office tomorrow, Tuesday.

I messaged my manager who was now partly invested in this drama. He told me to ask Kevin if I could go in despite the
mandatory work from home day to receive, at last, my package. I subjected Kevin to an abbreviated version of this story
and he told me to be sure to sit near the door because sometimes they don't ring the bell. Crisis averted? The scroll bar
says otherwise.

## Ghost Town

###### ![A spooky ghost](assets/ghost.jpeg)

On Tuesday, March 10th, I went in to work. The office was empty. It was eerie. I might have enjoyed it more, but
I felt like I couldn't take my eyes off the main door for too long. At around 1:15 PM, Kevin arrived at the office.
His kids were home from school because of the virus and he couldn't focus. He was surprised that FedEx hadn't come yet.
He asked me for the tracking number and gave them a call. Somehow, he managed to speak to a human. I don't know how
he did it. Probably why I'm the one who does Computer Science and he's the one who does Human Resources. Kevin explained that
we were waiting for a package and wanted to know why it hadn't been delivered. He got progressively angrier at whomever he
was speaking to, which made me like him more, but did little to get my package delivered. When he got off the phone, I refreshed
the tracking page and saw that a delivery attempt had been made but the "Customer not available or business closed".

I was certainly there and the business was certainly not closed. I was starting to think that the laptop did not
really exist. Or perhaps it was me. Apartment/suite number incorrect. Business closed. Customer no longer substantive/alive.

To prove to someone that I was still on this mortal plane, I called the only person that could confirm my identity - Dell.
I was real. They would look into it and follow up with me. They did so and confirmed the address a couple more times.

Finally, I received a call from FedEx at 3:47 PM. This was a call from FedEx's actual number, not the cell phone of
one of their delivery drivers. I confirmed my identity for this person as well. After some discussion involving
door tags, attempted deliveries, and addresses new and old, I learned that Dell had not given FedEx the company name
or floor number of my work address. In a building with many companies and several floors, this made it quite
hard for them to deliver the laptop. Yet, something tells me that they weren't trying too hard. They do, after all, have my
phone number.

So I told the FedEx representative to update the address with my company name and floor number. He said he would do so,
but could not guarantee that my package would be delivered because three delivery attempts had already been made.
Apparently, the ones at the first address count towards that total. Apparently, FedEx's three delivery attempt policy
is an unbreakable law. The FedEx representative asked if I would be able to pick up the package in Wilmington, MA from the
FedEx location there. I have no way to get to Wilmington, so I said no. Now, you might be wondering why my package went
from Quincy, south of Boston, to Wilmington to the north of Boston. Not through Boston, I assure you. On Monday night,
it travelled from Quincy to Connecticut and then back up to Wilmington, MA. Capitalistic market pressures will
force businesses to reduce inefficiencies to stay profitable.

I told the representative to update the address and deliver my package. He said he would try, but offered no guarantees.
I thanked him and hung up.

Maybe I didn't thank him. I forget.

## Deliver Me Lord Every Evil

When I arrived home Tuesday, I had in my mailbox a postcard from FedEx. It was dated Thursday, March 5th and informed
me that FedEx was awaiting additional shipment information and that I could provide it through their website. That was
a lie. I could provide no information through their website. The other interesting thing about the postcard is that it
was in my mailbox despite my "Incorrect address - Apartment/Suite number".

On Wednesday, March 11th, I received my laptop at work. I was happy, but also a little disappointed that more things
didn't go wrong. The elevator did not break. FedEx did not halt service due to the Coronavirus. No delivery drivers
were robbed. The laptop had not been swapped for 2.7 pounds of jelly beans. It was a thoroughly boring delivery in the end.

Confession: I wrote that on Tuesday night in an attempt to jinx myself. It didn't work, which sort of means that it did.
Either way, I have my laptop.

---

## Morals, Allegories, Etc.

So what did I learn?

It's hard to trust people, but we should all do it more. Some of your closest friends may break your trust by not
delivering your package when they say they will. Yet, if we all extend a little more trust, the way Dell trusted me
to pay for my laptop even after they started shipping it, we might waste less time confirming our identities to
legions of customer service representatives. We might even be able to leave a package outside the door and not
bother signing for it. Sure, it might get stolen, but this is America. We can trust the police to get it back asap.
 ˝Å§*A post-modern Odyssey  
fedex"Incorrect Address  ˆLonny, the giraffe, was worried about lightning. Lightning, Lonny knew, seeks the shortest path to the ground, and therefore tends to strike the tallest thing around. Lonny, being a giraffe, was often the tallest thing around. This worried him.

And so, when thunderclouds appeared in the distance, Lonny would bend his great long neck to the ground and wait anxiously for the storm to pass. Lonny was kind and friendly and generally well-liked, but when storms came and Lonny put his head down in the grass and stood quivering, unable to move or engage in friendly conversation, it made the other giraffes nervous and confused. In their nervousness and confusion, they would tease him and then run off to play in the pool or with large metal poles which they would hold in their mouths and compete to see who could raise their pole the highest. The other giraffes did not understand lightning.

So it was that on this particular Tuesday, Lonny found himself quite alone in the savannah being pelted by fat, heavy raindrops, as thunder rumbled all around, face-to-face with a crocodile.

 "Hello," said Lonny.

 "Hello," said Al. "I'm Al."

 "Pleased to meet you," said Lonny, who was in no way going to be so foolish as to share his name with any crocodile, and especially not this one who had scuttled up quite sneakily, and especially not in this rain, and especially, especially not on a Tuesday.

"Likewise," said Al, well aware that Lonny had violated the customary exchanging-of-names part of a civilized introduction, but content enough to read Lonny's name tag. It was just for lunch, after all.

"Lonny, I need your help," Al continued. "In an attempt to better understand the principles governing lightning, I was flying my kite just now in the storm. Alas, the kite has become stuck in the branches of that tall tree. My small crocodile neck prevents me from reaching it. Lonny, in the name of science, would you be so kind as to retrieve my kite?"

Lonny cautiously lifted his head an inch off the ground to look at the tree. Indeed, there was a kite tangled high in its boughs, flapping in the wind wildly, yet weakly, rather like a lanky animal flailing in quicksand. Al's story seemed plausible, but crocodiles, Lonny knew, are a shifty bunch. He needed more details.

 "What's a crocodile studying electromagnetism for? Besides, don't you know that Benjamin Franklin did the whole kite thing already?"

This is one well-educated giraffe, thought Al. The gig was up.

 "I'm no crocodile!" he said as he peeled off his fake pointed snout, revealing a rounded one underneath. The name Al, was, of course, short for Alligator.

 "Aaaahhh," exclaimed Lonny. His fear of lightning was suddenly replaced by his fear of alligators. Lonny's neck sprung upright.

Unfortunately, his head's rapid change in altitude caused the blood to drain from his brain, and Lonny, overcome with dizziness, toppled over into the adjacent pool of quicksand. As he sank, he writhed wildly, yet weakly, rather like a certain kite.

The quicksand had just reached his shoulders when a blast of lightning cracked nearby, so close that Lonny could feel its heat. He yelped and ducked his head. Unfortunately, the ducking turned into more of a plunging, a plunging into the oozing quicksand, which happily swallowed Lonny whole.

Al, feeling dejected about his unconvincing disguise, his failed - and apparently unoriginal - science experiment, and his now absent, deceased, and swallowed-whole lunch plan, scuttled home, dropped out of his PhD program, and succumbed to alcoholism, just as his mother had always feared.

Now that the rain had stopped, the other giraffes, meanwhile, were being devoured by a group of vultures who were beginning to wonder if they could maybe capture the wild power of lightning and channel it into some sort of cooking apparatus with a timer, heating coils, and different crispiness settings. Charred giraffe tastes so much better.

Why do we think we need to review everything that we see?


Like who the f--- am I?

I‚Äôm in the museum leaving yelp reviews of Monet. It's Monet! There are maybe one or two people with enough expertise to qualify them to give Monet less than five stars. I‚Äôm not one of them. Yet I come strolling through and say, ‚ÄúEh I don't really like the huts that much. 3 stars.‚Äù

It's the internet‚Äôs fault. These damn websites let people publish their thoughts. An older friend of mine went to a Broadway show that he didn't like and posted on Facebook: ‚ÄúThe reviews are in, the new West Side Story is a stinkeroo.‚Äù What reviews are in? Are you the reviews? This single Facebook post is the reviews?

At least Facebook is infiltrated by the Russians.

Google Maps, on the other hand, is just full of dumb Americans. Or, as they like to call themselves, Local Guides. Google Maps will let you review anything. The Charles River has 4.8 stars. Local Guide Patrick Peeters thinks it has "nice views". He did not say why he was giving it only 4 stars. Maybe if the river had even nicer views, it could work its way up to a full five.

What does ‚ÄúThis is a 4 star river‚Äù even mean?

Restaurant reviews I can somewhat understand. Things like food quality, comfort, service, and atmosphere can be judged in a somewhat objective manner. Restaurant reviews are also helpful. People who eat food can use them to learn where they might find good food and avoid bad food. People who run restaurants might read that Local Guide Patrick Peeters thinks that their plastic green tablecloths are tacky and invest in some more fashionable blue tablecloths.

The Charles River, though, can't change its tablecloths or views. Nor is a review of a river helpful to anyone. No one should need help from Local Guide Patrick Peeters choosing a river.

If you're in Boston, you really only have 2 rivers to choose from. The Charles and the Muddy River. Now, which river you want really depends on your needs. Looking at how many stars a river has isn't going to answer any questions you might have about the river. Can I kayak in it? Is it home to killer geese? Can I hide a body in it? Local Guide Patrick Peeters says "4 Stars: nice views" which leaves me stuck in my kayak in the Muddy River as the geese close in. Meanwhile, the body I dumped in the Charles is going to get caught in the dam and they'll catch me. Thanks a lot, Patrick.

So I looked up the rest of Patrick's reviews, because I can, and it turns out that he's pretty stingy with his 5 stars. Out of 85 reviews, he only gave 11 places the full 5. That's about 13% of places. It makes the 4 stars for the Charles seem not so bad.

So now you must be asking, what other intriguing reviews has Local Guide Patrick Peeters left, or rather, gifted to the public?

4 stars to a bowling alley in the Netherlands. "Good place for bowling," advises Peeters. Thanks. I had been considering going bowling in the Charles. God bless you and your reviews Mr. Peeters.

I've gotten A's most of my life, so it bothers me on a personal level that Patrick gives 4-star reviews without providing actionable feedback. Reminds me of a certain entrepreneurial studies professor... What's wrong with the Charles River, Patrick!? Why did we get an 84 on our final group presentation, Lana!?

Neither have responded to my emails.

When I give reviews, I'm nice enough to provide actionable feedback. The Charles River, which I have just rated as 3 stars, should be less bendy because I get lost sometimes. It should also be warmer. I hate how cold it is when I retrieve my bowling pins. Monet (4 stars) should stop painting so many huts.

Unfortunately, the river and Monet have not responded to my emails either. Maybe it's the unprofessional husky.neu.edu domain that's discouraging them.

Having descended from Circle 3.25 of hell, the tortuous home of the nail pickers and nail biters with their bleeding stumps of fingers, I squinted through the mist to see an even more ghastly scene than the last. Illuminated by hellfire on either side, a long ornate table made of ice stretched before my eyes extending towards the dark pit of Satan. The horrid stench of human flatulence mixed with the cloyingly sweet scent of chocolate and filled my nose. I turned to my Guide, wondering aloud, ‚ÄúWhat cruel ring of hell is this? How did these poor souls stray in life to deserve such a fate?‚Äù

‚ÄúListen well and perhaps you will learn,‚Äù said He, the most venerable and wise Mr. Wonka, master of all that comes forth from the cacao plant. ‚ÄúHere is Circle Three and One Half. The damned are sent here by Minos for their sinful appetites and failure to obey their natural repulsions. See that one there who sits in agony at the head of the table? Approach him and learn from his sad story and eternal suffering.‚Äù

Ever obedient to the great Willy Wonka, I strolled forward. As I drew near, the stench intensified and I almost gagged. The pitiable wails of the damned grew louder and louder. Above this cacophony, the shade in front of me heard my living step and breath, and curious, he turned in his throne of ice.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúAm I not allowed to suffer here in peace?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI come from above,‚Äù I replied, ‚Äúin a desperate journey to free myself of sin. I fear that I too may end up at a table like this, perhaps even this very one. Guided by my Lord, the divine King of Chocolate, I come to learn the origins of evil and set myself on a path of righteousness. I beseech you: What is your name? What is the nature of your punishment? How did you fall so low?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name while I still walked the earth,‚Äù he began, ‚Äúwas Unterkoefler. Willy Unterkoefler. Look close and you will see my thighs are entombed in this icy chair. Thus I am stuck in this seat until the end of time. For my eternal torment and punishment, every morning on this table there appears a bowl of the most pure and delicious chocolate ice cream. I sit here and am forced to stare at it and drool. If I so much as glance away, the ice cream begins to melt into nothingness and the infernal pain in my stomach doubles.‚Äù

As that soul spoke, I examined the table and saw that all he said was true. The gilded bowl, no smaller than a standard mixing bowl, was full to the brim of heavenly scoops of divine chocolate ice cream. From its perfect aroma, I identified it as Haagen-Dazs. But as Willy Unterkoefler looked at me to tell his tale, the ice cream began to melt and his stomach convulsed and twisted grotesquely. He returned his gaze to the bowl and continued thus:

‚ÄúAnd each day at dusk, a spoon appears beside the bowl. For some six hours, the spoon is as hot as the fires of the Sixth Circle. Although it burns to touch, I often grab it anyways. Just as I ignored the consequences of eating dairy in life, I try to ignore them here. I was lactose intolerant, you see, but ate copious amounts of chocolate ice cream without regard. My instincts and my body - through stomach pain and awful gas  warned me not to, but so great was my love for my own sinful pleasure that I reasoned against my nature and ate myself right down to the bowels of hell.‚Äù

Having said this, Willy began to sob. His speech and weeping had struck close to home - I too eat ice cream despite my lactose intolerance. This would be my hell! I swooned.

When I awoke, Mr. Wonka pulled me to my feet and motioned for me to watch. It was close to midnight, and now Willy Unterkoefler was able to hold his spoon without a flinch. Still weeping, he lowered his spoon to the bowl, reached in, and pulled out with the most beautiful spoonful of the most divine double fudge brownie ice cream. Mr. Wonka saw me start to salivate and gave me a stern look of reprisal. Humbled, I looked on. Willy brought the spoon to his lips and just as he opened his mouth, the ice cream turned to vanilla! Disgusting! The damn√®d spirit dropped his spoon piteously.

I looked on in horror, appalled that any god or devil could devise such a cruel and evil punishment. I could not look away. At last, Mr. Wonka urged me along, saying, ‚ÄúSuch is the fate of those who resist their nature, or don‚Äôt take Lactaid pills.‚Äù
