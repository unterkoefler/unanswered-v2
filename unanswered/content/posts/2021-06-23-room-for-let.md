**Avail. Aug. 2nd - 31st**

**Single bedroom in 6-bed,2-bath Mission Hill apt.**

This cozy, sun-drenched, insufferably hot room boasts of two elegant, mostly-screened windows with breathtaking views of naked neighbors. It comes equipped with ample space for a bed or a desk. Further, the room assails one with the presence of a reach-in, half-closet shaped like a triangle, perfectly suited for the stowage of any and all triangular garments. The majority of the room's outlets provide the U.S. standard of 120 volt AC. For extra security, annoyance and puzzlement, the door has two knobs. Both of these must be turned to gain entry/egress. (Why? Please, tell me why. It keeps me up at night. Why, God, why? Who decided to install a second doorknob. Who?! Please...)

The common spaces are large, lovely, and wholly adequate:

- The in-unit laundry exists. It also shakes the entire building.
- The kitchen and its counters are expansive.
- In one bathroom, there is no mirror over the sink. The installer of the second doorknob, presumably, put the sink below the window. The water pressure is excellent, painful.
- There is a thermostat to control a central air conditioning unit, which mostly dumps all the heat onto the (lovely) porch, so that it may be re-absorbed into the (sun-drenched) bedroom.
- The living room has at times been described as spacious, crawling with ants, cozy, crack-den-esque, and perfect. The other occupants -- the ceiling squirrels included -- can be described likewise. You'll get along.

**Rent: $895, util. incl. Negotiable.**
